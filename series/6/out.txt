The moment I stepped out of town, the air changed. It got colder, heavy. The sunlight, already fading, felt like a desperate plea for attention. I felt it in my bones, that unsettling silence. The woods weren't completely quiet. There were sounds, of course, but all wrong, all unsettling. The rustle of unseen creatures, the crackle of branches, the distant hoot of an owl. None of those sounds held a place in the symphony of nature I knew. This was something different, something darker. A chill ran down my spine. It wasn't just the temperature, though that was cold enough. This was a different kind of chill, a shiver that started in my soul. I kept walking, the doll spinning in its dish, a beacon in the gathering gloom.  It wasn't leading me to a road or a clearing, not that I could tell. This felt like a path carved out of the woods themselves, like something out of a fairytale, except the story wasn't going to have a happy ending. I hated fairytales. Always so neat and tidy, with a hero always getting the girl and the villain getting his comeuppance. Life was messy, reality was a tangled mess of good and bad, all tangled together. And I was starting to think, with this whole doll thing, we'd stumbled into a chapter where the villain might just win.

Through the trees, a dilapidated cabin appeared. Relief flickered in my chest, but something felt off. The silence remained unbroken despite the supposed guards.  I approached cautiously, spotting several rough-looking figures patrolling the perimeter.  They were bigger than most, with thick arms and faces that looked carved out of granite,  their eyes like burnt embers in the deepening dusk.  I moved through the underbrush, careful not to be spotted.  

The cabin was a ramshackle affair, leaning against the wind, the paint peeling, the roof sagging. A sense of foreboding hung in the air, heavy as a shroud.  I saw the doll spinning again, slow and deliberate, its porcelain face illuminated by the faint glow of the moon. It was almost mocking, this little porcelain harbinger of whatever dark magic was brewing inside. 

I needed a plan, a way to get inside without setting off the alarms, whatever those were.   Then I heard it, a low growl, barely a sound, but I felt it in my bones. The creature was big, I knew that, and it was closer than I thought. I took a step back, trying to blend into the shadows. I couldn't afford to be seen. Not yet. 

From behind the cabin, a figure emerged.  Not the hulking brute I’d expected.  It was Krabat.  The way he stood, a casual lean against a tree, the way he surveyed the perimeter, it was like he was watching over the whole damn woods.  He saw me, of course, his black eyes catching the faint moonlight like polished obsidian.  He didn’t say anything, just a slight nod of his head.  I knew I was in for some twisted kind of conversation.

He didn’t say anything, just a slight nod of his head. I knew I was in for some twisted kind of conversation. I crept closer, staying low, hidden in the shadows. The moonlight cast long, skeletal fingers across the overgrown lawn, revealing the faces of the guards.  They were the same, all of them. Average faces, forgettable, like they'd been poured from the same mold. Except for the twins. Or at least I thought it was the twins. There were more of them, at least half a dozen now. I thought I’d seen it all, but the sight of those duplicate faces, all with that same vacant stare, made my gut twist. 

I needed to get in, get to the girl, but I was out of time. My options were dwindling. Could I sneak past them? The moonlight was playing tricks on my eyes, distorting the shadows, making them dance. Each one of those faces could be the one that noticed me. It was like looking into a hall of mirrors, each reflection echoing my own fear. 

Then one of them, a lanky guy with a greasy, black ponytail, stepped closer. He peered through the darkness, his eyes suspicious. I couldn’t stay hidden any longer. My options were running out, and I was out of time.

There was no time for a silent approach. I moved with a burst of speed, a clay-built blur. I slammed into the nearest guard, my fist a hammer blow. He went down like a sack of potatoes, his eyes wide with shock. The others turned, confusion in their eyes, but I was already moving, a whirlwind of punches and kicks, my body absorbing the force of their attacks, turning their blows into useless blurs. I moved with an animalistic grace, using the shadows as cover, taking advantage of their surprise, my movements honed by decades of fighting the same monsters over and over.  I kept them off balance, moving like a phantom, a nightmare they couldn't grasp. The scent of sweat and fear filled the air, a sickening, metallic tang. 

I couldn’t let them grab me. If they did, I’d be a clay statue in seconds. They’d just have to hold me down long enough for the sun to rise. That was all they needed.

I couldn’t let them grab me. I knew what they wanted, and what they would do to me. I’d seen it before. The sun would bake me like a clay brick, and I’d crumble into dust.

But I wasn’t about to go down without a fight.

One by one, they went down. Four of them lay on the ground, unconscious, their identical faces contorted in pain. The others scattered, their panicked shouts echoing through the woods. I stood there, panting, my clay body bruised but whole.

I looked at the fallen guards. They all looked exactly the same. Twins would have been possible, I supposed, though unlikely. But murderous sextuplets? 

Magic, I realized. They weren't human. They were constructs, like me. Golems, maybe? Or something even weirder.  

I’d dealt with my share of strange creatures in Shadow Falls. But this was different. This was something new. Something I didn’t understand.

The woods were silent except for the rustling of leaves and the creaking of branches. The moonlight painted everything in shades of silver and black. I was alone again.

I turned and walked away, my boots crunching on the dry leaves. I was heading back to town. There was a girl to save, and a mystery to unravel. 

This was Shadow Falls, and strange things happened here. But this felt different. This felt like the start of something bigger. Something dark and dangerous.

I crept through the woods, my boots crunching on the dry leaves. The cabin was a short distance away, its silhouette barely visible in the moonlight. I didn't see any sign of the men who'd chased me.  I figured they were probably regrouping. I needed to be careful. There could be more of them. I reached the edge of the clearing. The cabin stood alone, its wooden walls weathered and gray. The windows were boarded up, and the door hung crooked on its hinges.  A porch swing creaked gently in the breeze. It looked like it had been abandoned for years. I checked the perimeter. Nothing. I moved closer, my hand resting on the revolver in my holster.  I knew I was walking into a trap, but I had to find out what was going on. I had to find that girl.  The cabin door was unlocked. I pushed it open and stepped inside.  Dust swirled in the air as I entered, settling on my boots and trousers. The air inside was thick and stale, smelling of decay and something else I couldn’t quite place. The air was heavy, like it was holding its breath. I felt like I was suffocating.  The cabin was small and sparsely furnished. A single bare bulb hung from the ceiling, casting a dim yellow light. The furniture was covered in dust sheets. A fire had been built in the fireplace, but the embers were cold. The place was silent, except for the sound of my own breath. It looked like someone had left in a hurry.  I walked through the cabin, my eyes scanning every inch. The furniture was overturned, and the walls were scratched.  In the corner, I saw a pile of clothes. They looked like they had been thrown there in a rush. I picked up a shirt. It was stained with blood. I knew that was where they’d taken her.  I checked the other rooms. The bedroom was small and dusty. The bed was unmade, the sheets pulled back as if someone had been sleeping there.  A book lay open on the nightstand, its pages dog-eared and stained. I could have sworn it was a book of shadows, though I couldn’t make out any words. I was starting to feel like I was in one of those old horror movies Anna loved to watch. The ones where the lonely cabin in the woods was always hiding a dark secret.   I checked the bathroom. It was just a small room with a sink and toilet.  I pulled a small box of matches from my coat pocket and lit one.  I needed a little light.  The bathroom had a single window, but it was boarded up.  I checked behind the toilet. Nothing.  I checked under the sink.  I pulled out the garbage can.  I kicked it over, sending a cloud of dust into the air.  There was something in the garbage.  I reached into the trash.  It felt cold. I pulled it out.  It was a piece of paper. I held it up to the match, and its contents were revealed.  A crude map. And an address.  But the map wasn’t drawn for a town. It was drawn for a place.  A place where I knew magic thrived.  The address was written in a language I couldn’t understand.  But I knew it was a language of magic.  The girl was in danger.  And I was going to get her back.

My gaze swept the cabin once more, a grim determination hardening my features. I had to find a way out, a way in. A way to follow the trail of this map, to find the girl. The floorboards beneath my feet creaked in protest as I shifted my weight. My fingers grazed the wood, feeling for any imperfections. 

There. A loose board near the fireplace. The wood was old and warped, yielding to my touch. It gave way with a satisfying snap. Underneath lay a dark, gaping hole. The air inside was stagnant, smelling faintly of damp earth and something else, something ancient and unsettling. A secret passage.

I reached for my coat pocket, pulling out a small flashlight.  Its beam illuminated the rough-hewn steps leading downward. The air grew thick and stale as I descended, a faint, musky odor clinging to the darkness. My heart pounded in my chest, a drumbeat of anticipation and dread. 

I had a feeling this wasn’t going to be easy.

My heart pounded in my chest, a drumbeat of anticipation and dread. I had a feeling this wasn’t going to be easy. 

After what felt like an eternity, the passage opened into a small, dimly lit chamber. In the center, bound and slumped against a wall, sat Charlaine, dirt smudging her cheeks. Dried tears traced glistening paths through the grime. Relief washed over me, a wave of warmth battling the chill of the underground space.

Hurrying to her side, I knelt, throwing caution to the wind. I fumbled with the thick ropes binding Charlaine’s wrists. Charlaine’s eyes fluttered open, unfocused at first, then widening in recognition. A flicker of relief crossed her face, quickly replaced by confusion and a tremor that ran through her body. She croaked out, her voice hoarse, “Jam? What… what happened?”

“Easy there, kiddo,” I said, my voice gruff with relief. “You’re alright. Just a little roughed up.”

I worked quickly, my calloused fingers tugging at the ropes, loosening the knots. She looked at me, fear and confusion etched on her face. It made me want to punch something, anything, to let out the frustration that had been building up inside me.

“Where are we?” she rasped, her voice barely a whisper.

“Underneath that cabin,” I said, gesturing towards the opening of the passage. “A nice little hideaway for somebody.”

“Who?” she whispered, her eyes scanning the room.  

The chamber was spartan, just a few bare walls and a single rickety table. There was no furniture, no personal belongings. It looked like a makeshift prison, a place meant to be temporary. The air was thick and heavy, smelling of dust and mildew.

“We’ll figure that out later,” I said, helping her to her feet.  “Right now, let’s get you out of here.”

I knew that the danger wasn’t over. Whoever took her, whoever built this underground lair, wasn’t going to just let us walk away. They’d be watching, waiting for their chance to strike. But for now, I had to get her to safety.

“Are you hurt?” I asked, examining her for any injuries.

She shook her head, but a grimace crossed her face.

“Just a little bruised,” she mumbled, “and my hands are numb.”

I glanced at her wrists, where the ropes had cut into her skin, leaving red marks. 

“Come on,” I said, my voice rough. “Let’s go.” 

I helped her up, careful not to jar her injured wrists. We started back towards the passage, my hand resting lightly on her back. She leaned against me, her body trembling slightly. She was a tough cookie, that one, but even she couldn’t handle what she’d been through. 

As we climbed the steps, I glanced back at the chamber, a sense of unease settling over me. It was a place that had seen darkness, a place where secrets were kept. I knew that whatever happened here, whatever was behind this kidnapping, wouldn’t be easily forgotten. 

The air outside was sweet and crisp, a welcome contrast to the musty air of the underground chamber. I could see the faint outline of the cabin through the trees. It was time to get out of here. We had a lot to talk about, and a lot of questions to answer. But first, we had to get Charlaine out of the woods.
