  snippet: 'wisps of smoke on the summer breeze. My mind spun with questions. Where
    had they vanished to? How the hell did they manage to slip through my fingers
    like greased piglets at a county fair? My feet carried me back toward Maple Lane''s
    center, the sound of lemonade glass shattering against the sidewalk lost in the
    murmur of crickets and the rustling of leaves. No sign of them anywhere! I headed
    back to the lemonade stand to look for clues. I kneeled down, eyes scouring the
    ground like a maniac searching for dropped change. Nothing. Zilch. Not even a
    single bloody footprint. I touched the pavement. It felt colder than it should
    be, like the city''s very bones were sucking up the warmth from my skin. I sniffed
    the air, trying to pick out anything out of place, and my nostrils twitched at
    the acrid stench of ozone. Flickers of clover hung suspended in the atmosphere
    like a faint echo, a residue left behind by someone''s hasty spellcasting. Someone
    with access to real power had teleported those twins away from me. I gritted my
    teeth. My problem child of an investigation had just turned nuclear hot. If a
    mage was involved, then this was no longer petty human-on-human crime. I had to
    call it in, and I didn''t like it one bit. Shadow Falls just got a whole lot more
    complicated. And so did my life as its chief lawkeeper. I sighed and bought a
    second lemonade to combat the heat. I took a long swig, feeling the wet glass
    soothe my parched throat. A faint hint of ozone still lingered in the air, reminding
    me of the teleportation spell that had so thoroughly rained on my parade. I strolled
    back to city hall, my clay feet moving in a slow, deliberate gait. The humid air
    wrapped around me like a damp shroud. I could practically feel the city''s latest
    secrets dripping with sweat from its stone streets, begging to be unraveled by
    me. My eyes roved over the familiar sights and sounds of Maple Lane -- Peabody''s
    corner store, where they stocked more than just lottery tickets; the creaky old
    train station, where you could almost hear the ghostly echoes of late-night whistle
    blows; even Ol'' Macdonald''s farm fresh produce stand, which had somehow managed
    to remain stubbornly in business for three generations. Shadow Falls was my city:
    my home, my beat, and my life. But this little slice of peace just got turned
    inside out. It seemed like I wasn''t the only one playing by a different set of
    rules than regular townsfolk. Every brick seemed to bear down upon me, questioning
    everything. Had someone from out there been poking their nose into Shadow Falls''
    affairs? What did they want with my serial killer? Time to put on my thinking
    clay, rehydrate with some old-fashioned Java at the station, and conjure up a
    plan. This city might be mine to guard, but its magic was another story altogether.'
  summary: "Jam Slate, the golem sheriff of Shadow Falls, had been enjoying a peaceful\
    \ period until a string of recent murders indicated the arrival of a serial killer\
    \ in town. While Jam pursued the killer through the scorching streets of Shadow\
    \ Falls, he found himself forced to confront his own vulnerability: his reliance\
    \ on water for survival, which left him increasingly weak under the oppressive\
    \ summer heat.\n\nAfter a tense pursuit across the town's rooftops, Jam finally\
    \ cornered the killer in an abandoned basement, only to discover that he was not\
    \ alone. A second, identical individual appeared, firing at Jam and forcing him\
    \ to endure multiple bullet holes before disarming and incapacitating him. The\
    \ second individual also vanished in a flash, leaving no trace. Jam's pursuit\
    \ ended with a bizarre discovery: the missing twins, along with a lingering scent\
    \ of ozone and a palpable coldness in the air. A powerful mage had seemingly teleported\
    \ the killers, rendering Jam\u2019s efforts meaningless.\n\nAs Jam recovers with\
    \ a much-needed glass of lemonade, he is left to grapple with the realization\
    \ that Shadow Falls has a hidden magical aspect, one that had remained dormant\
    \ until now. The introduction of a mage adds a new layer of complexity to the\
    \ already chilling mystery. Jam's quiet town has been disrupted by forces far\
    \ greater than anything he had ever encountered before. He will need to unravel\
    \ this new secret and prepare for the unexpected.  His search for a seemingly\
    \ simple serial killer has transformed into a fight for the city's very soul.\
    \ The peaceful serenity of Shadow Falls is now veiled in a sense of unknown dread,\
    \ as a new chapter unfolds in Jam Slate's life."
