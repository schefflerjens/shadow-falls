  snippet: 'wisps of smoke on the summer breeze. My mind spun with questions. Where
    had they vanished to? How the hell did they manage to slip through my fingers
    like greased piglets at a county fair? My feet carried me back toward Maple Lane''s
    center, the sound of lemonade glass shattering against the sidewalk lost in the
    murmur of crickets and the rustling of leaves. No sign of them anywhere! I headed
    back to the lemonade stand to look for clues. I kneeled down, eyes scouring the
    ground like a maniac searching for dropped change. Nothing. Zilch. Not even a
    single bloody footprint. I touched the pavement. It felt colder than it should
    be, like the city''s very bones were sucking up the warmth from my skin. I sniffed
    the air, trying to pick out anything out of place, and my nostrils twitched at
    the acrid stench of ozone. Flickers of clover hung suspended in the atmosphere
    like a faint echo, a residue left behind by someone''s hasty spellcasting. Someone
    with access to real power had teleported those twins away from me. I gritted my
    teeth. My problem child of an investigation had just turned nuclear hot. If a
    mage was involved, then this was no longer petty human-on-human crime. I had to
    call it in, and I didn''t like it one bit. Shadow Falls just got a whole lot more
    complicated. And so did my life as its chief lawkeeper. I sighed and bought a
    second lemonade to combat the heat. I took a long swig, feeling the wet glass
    soothe my parched throat. A faint hint of ozone still lingered in the air, reminding
    me of the teleportation spell that had so thoroughly rained on my parade. I strolled
    back to city hall, my clay feet moving in a slow, deliberate gait. The humid air
    wrapped around me like a damp shroud. I could practically feel the city''s latest
    secrets dripping with sweat from its stone streets, begging to be unraveled by
    me. My eyes roved over the familiar sights and sounds of Maple Lane -- Peabody''s
    corner store, where they stocked more than just lottery tickets; the creaky old
    train station, where you could almost hear the ghostly echoes of late-night whistle
    blows; even Ol'' Macdonald''s farm fresh produce stand, which had somehow managed
    to remain stubbornly in business for three generations. Shadow Falls was my city:
    my home, my beat, and my life. But this little slice of peace just got turned
    inside out. It seemed like I wasn''t the only one playing by a different set of
    rules than regular townsfolk. Every brick seemed to bear down upon me, questioning
    everything. Had someone from out there been poking their nose into Shadow Falls''
    affairs? What did they want with my serial killer? Time to put on my thinking
    clay, rehydrate with some old-fashioned Java at the station, and conjure up a
    plan. This city might be mine to guard, but its magic was another story altogether.'
