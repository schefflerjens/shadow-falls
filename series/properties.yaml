  snippet: 'wisps of smoke on the summer breeze. My mind spun with questions. Where
    had they vanished to? How the hell did they manage to slip through my fingers
    like greased piglets at a county fair? My feet carried me back toward Maple Lane''s
    center, the sound of lemonade glass shattering against the sidewalk lost in the
    murmur of crickets and the rustling of leaves. No sign of them anywhere! I headed
    back to the lemonade stand to look for clues. I kneeled down, eyes scouring the
    ground like a maniac searching for dropped change. Nothing. Zilch. Not even a
    single bloody footprint. I touched the pavement. It felt colder than it should
    be, like the city''s very bones were sucking up the warmth from my skin. I sniffed
    the air, trying to pick out anything out of place, and my nostrils twitched at
    the acrid stench of ozone. Flickers of clover hung suspended in the atmosphere
    like a faint echo, a residue left behind by someone''s hasty spellcasting. Someone
    with access to real power had teleported those twins away from me. I gritted my
    teeth. My problem child of an investigation had just turned nuclear hot. If a
    mage was involved, then this was no longer petty human-on-human crime. I had to
    call it in, and I didn''t like it one bit. Shadow Falls just got a whole lot more
    complicated. And so did my life as its chief lawkeeper. I sighed and bought a
    second lemonade to combat the heat. I took a long swig, feeling the wet glass
    soothe my parched throat. A faint hint of ozone still lingered in the air, reminding
    me of the teleportation spell that had so thoroughly rained on my parade. I strolled
    back to city hall, my clay feet moving in a slow, deliberate gait. The humid air
    wrapped around me like a damp shroud. I could practically feel the city''s latest
    secrets dripping with sweat from its stone streets, begging to be unraveled by
    me. My eyes roved over the familiar sights and sounds of Maple Lane -- Peabody''s
    corner store, where they stocked more than just lottery tickets; the creaky old
    train station, where you could almost hear the ghostly echoes of late-night whistle
    blows; even Ol'' Macdonald''s farm fresh produce stand, which had somehow managed
    to remain stubbornly in business for three generations. Shadow Falls was my city:
    my home, my beat, and my life. But this little slice of peace just got turned
    inside out. It seemed like I wasn''t the only one playing by a different set of
    rules than regular townsfolk. Every brick seemed to bear down upon me, questioning
    everything. Had someone from out there been poking their nose into Shadow Falls''
    affairs? What did they want with my serial killer? Time to put on my thinking
    clay, rehydrate with some old-fashioned Java at the station, and conjure up a
    plan. This city might be mine to guard, but its magic was another story altogether.'

  snippet: magic." I longingly stared at a defunct espresso maker. "Speaking of, this
    seems to be the first sign of magical elements involved. Complicates things."
    I pulled out the crumpled ziploc bag from my pocket. "You know, these things aren't
    cheap, you'd think they could make them bulletproof." I concentrated and enclosed
    the garlic bag with a thin layer of clay. Problem solved. "Rules are rules, Jam,"
    Anna said. "As much as I hate it, we've got to call this in." I shrugged. "It'll
    make it harder to do my job, Anna. To keep the town safe." "You think you and
    Charlaine can do that alone now? Magic's involved. Which means you could be at
    risk, too." "Bureau's gonna be here soon after the call. Probably gonna tear the
    whole place apart. They'll mess things up, they always do." Anna sighed. "You
    know I hate it when they're here, too. But they're good at their job, Jam. More
    than you give them credit for. We need their experience." "Yeah, well, I've got
    my own experience. And I'd rather solve this myself." "You need more than just
    experience, Jam. You need manpower, competent one." Anna was getting impatient.
    "And yes, we'll also need to call Krabat. And no, he's not my 'Igor', I swear.
    Just helping me with some research." "Alright, alright, Anna. Just don't let him
    turn us all into fluffy white rabbits." Anna just shook her head. "I'll tell you
    what, you go back to the station and I'll start making some calls. You have a
    hunch about this case? Anything at all?" "Got a feeling," I replied, "but I ain't
    sharing it with those goons in suits. It's gotta be me, Anna. It's always gotta
    be me." I stood up and headed for the door. "Don't let those suits ruin everything.
    You know how it is." "I do." She looked at me with a mixture of resignation and
    hope. "Keep me posted, alright, Jam?" I nodded. At the end of the day, when the
    chips were down, I knew I could count on her. "You got it." I left her office,
    that damn stink of garlic still in the air. I saw an empty coffee mug and grimaced.
    Needed another pot. Needed a cigarette. Needed a goddamn break. But Shadow Falls
    was never gonna let me have one. "Time to head out, Charlaine," I said and grabbed
    my hat from the rack. Couple of days, tops, before they'd show up. Charlaine was
    already packed up and waiting. "Ready when you are, Jam." The entire Shadow Falls
    sheriff's department stepped out into the hallway and back into the business of
    catching a killer. The case wasn't even a week old and it was already getting
    complicated. The air was thick with the smell of rain, a scent that was as familiar
    to me as the back of my hand. "Let's go," I said, taking a deep breath of the
    damp air, "It's time to figure out what we're dealing with."

    \ Two identical individuals, seemingly teleported by a powerful mage, had vanished,\
    \ leaving behind a palpable chill and the scent of ozone. \n\nThe discovery of\

    \ now, on my watch. Like I always told Anna, one step at a time. I turned back\

    \ Charlaine was gone. They had left without a word, like they\u2019d been swallowed\

    \ again, sure of it now. A sudden rush of dread washed over me. I glanced at the\

    \ \u201CDisappeared? Like a puff of smoke?\u201D She shook her head again. \u201C\
    More like a sudden chill,\u201D she whispered, her gaze shifting towards the door.\
    \ \u201CLike something... went by.\u201D I stared at the spot where Charlaine\

    \ a sudden wave of fear. They were gone. Vanished. Just like that. And this time,\
    \ I had no idea who to blame but myself. But I knew one thing: I couldn't let\
    \ them disappear without a trace. I took a slow breath, trying to calm my nerves.\
    \ \"Millie,\" I said, my voice a low growl. \"You seen anyone come in or out here\
    \ recently?\" \"Not since those two left. They just, well, disappeared. Poof!\
    \ Like magic.\" I nodded. Magic's a dirty word in Shadow Falls, a word that brought\
    \ back memories of the old days, memories I didn't want to revisit. I scanned\
    \ the faces around me, searching for anything, anyone, that might hold a clue.\
    \ There was the usual cast of characters, but none of them had the means to pull\
    \ of this disappearing act. Except probably Krabat, and he was gone now. The damn\
    \ sorcerer. He was up to something, but I couldn't put my finger on it. Now they\
    \ were gone, whisked away by some unseen force, and I had a bad feeling about\
    \ it. I was on my own now. But I wouldn't stop until I found Charlaine and Krabat,\
    \ even if it was the last thing I did. This town was a damn powder keg, and I\
    \ wasn't about to let it explode."
  summary: Sheriff Jam Slate and his deputy, Charlaine, continued their investigation
    into the mysterious disappearance of two identical individuals who had vanished
    after being apprehended in an abandoned basement. Following a trail of magical
    dust, they discovered a worn leather rosette, identical to one Jam carried, leading
    them to Fangs and Fur, a local saloon known for its unusual clientele. At the
    saloon, they encountered Krabat, a local mage and collector of relics, who displayed
    a keen interest in the rosette and hinted at a possible connection to the missing
    individuals. While questioning patrons about the rosette, a brawl erupted between
    a human, Bruno, and an ogre, Grog. Jam intervened, calming the situation by offering
    the brawlers expensive liquor. As Jam turned to resume the investigation, he noticed
    Krabat and Charlaine were gone, vanished without a trace. This chilling incident
    evoked memories of the previous disappearances, leaving Jam feeling a surge of
    fear and dread. The scent of ozone lingered in the air, indicating the presence
    of magic. Jam, now alone, resolved to find Charlaine and Krabat, determined to
    uncover the truth behind the disappearances and protect his town from the escalating
    threat.

  snippet: of energy coursing through my body, a tingling sensation that spread from
    my fingertips to my toes. Closing my eyes, I braced myself for whatever was about
    to happen. When I opened my eyes, I was no longer in the storage unit. I was in
    a different place. A place I'd never seen before. It was a vast, empty space,
    the walls shimmering with an ethereal light. The air was thick with a strange
    spirit, a feeling of power and mystery. I looked around, trying to make sense
    of my surroundings. There was nothing here, just the endless expanse of the void.
    Then, I felt someone watching me. Turning slowly, my hand instinctively reaching
    for my gun. But there was nothing there. Just the empty space, the shimmering
    walls, and the eerie silence. I was alone. Or was I? A deep growl echoed from
    afar, sending shivers down my spine. It slowly approached, getting closer and
    closer. I could feel the air growing colder, the darkness pressing in on me. The
    growl turned into a snarl, and a pair of glowing red eyes appeared, followed by
    a giant hound weaving in and out of the shadows. The beast was big as an ox, and
    it did not seem pleased to see me. I clenched my fists, bracing myself for whatever
    was about to happen. Then, a voice, raspy and cold, whispered in my ear. "Welcome
    to the spirit world, Sheriff Slate. I've been expecting you." Standing before
    me, bathed in the eerie blue light of the circle, was a hooded figure I'd never
    seen before. Tall and lean, possibly human, though it was hard to tell. The creature
    wore a long black tattered coat, the collar pulled up around its neck. A straw
    hat cast a shadow over its face, hiding it in darkness. "Who are you?" I growled,
    my voice tight. The figure chuckled, a dry, rasping sound. "Names have power for
    me and my kin. You may call me... Eshu." It stepped forward, eyes glinting in
    the blue light. The shadows around him seemed to writhe and twist, as if they
    were alive. The giant dog was still there but kept its distance. "You're the one
    behind this, aren't you?" My voice hardened. "The disappearances, the strange
    happenings..." Eshu tilted his head. "Perhaps. Perhaps not." He took another step
    closer, his eyes boring into mine. "I'm here to offer you a deal, Sheriff Slate."
    "What kind of deal?" "A deal that will benefit us both. I need your help in the
    world of the living, Sheriff. And in return, I can give you something you've been
    searching for." My gut twisted. Graveyards are full of people who make deals with
    shadowy entities in magical dimensions. But did I really have a choice if I wanted
    Charlaine back? "What do you want?" "I want you to find someone for me, Sheriff.
    Someone who's dear to a follower of mine. Also, I want you to stop calling me
    Daddy Longlegs."

    \ her. \"What's the seal?\" \"Looks like a wolf,\" she said, her voice low. \"\
    Could be a dog, too.\" Anna held the envelope close to the desk lamp, scrutinizing\
    \ it from all angles. It appeared completely ordinary, even under the harsh light.\
    \ With a sigh, she decided to just open it. As her finger pressed down on the\

    \ waving away the sparkling dust. \"Glitter bomb?\" she asked incredulously. We\
    \ looked back at the envelope, now lying split open on the desk. The interior\
    \ was still plain, no hidden compartments, no scorching marks. Just harmless,\
    \ sparkly chaos. But beneath the glitter, nestled in the folds of the envelope,\
    \ lay a tiny, intricately carved wooden doll. The doll was cold to the touch in\
    \ my hand, yet the wood felt strangely alive beneath my fingers. On its smooth\
    \ back, a single name was etched in a delicate script: Charlaine Meyers. A chill\
    \ ran down my spine. Despite what Charlaine thought, I recognized voodoo when\
    \ I saw it. I'd seen enough of it in Shadow Falls to know that it wasn't something\
    \ to be trifled with. I turned the doll over in my hands again. It was small,\
    \ no bigger than my thumb, but it felt heavy, almost alive. What to do, I thought?\
    \ When I put the doll back on the table, it started to turn. Slowly, almost imperceptibly,\
    \ it rotated about forty-five degrees to the left. I watched it, my breath catching\
    \ in my throat. I rotated the doll back to its original position. It turned again,\
    \ back to the same spot. \"Guess there's our magic compass,\" I said, a nervous\
    \ laugh escaping my lips. Charlaine grabbed an empty petri dish and laid the tiny\
    \ doll inside of it. She got up and walked across the room, the doll spinning\
    \ in the dish. It kept pointing in the same direction, like a home-made water\
    \ compass. She handed the dish to me. \"Go bring them back,\" she said. \"Bring\
    \ who back?\" \"Charlaine and Krabat. Your deputy's grandma is a mambo, rigth?\
    \ A voodoo priestess? She must have arranged for some divine intervention, should\
    \ any harm come to her family.\" \"Perks of her job? It's as good a theory as\
    \ any,\" I said with a shrug. I took the petri dish and headed out the door. The\
    \ doll spun in the dish, pointing me towards the outskirts of town. Or maybe even\
    \ further out, into the woods. Finding anyone out there was like hunting a needle\

    Jam, now tasked with finding this unknown person, sought advice from the mayor,

    and manipulation, and that he could not be trusted. Despite her reservations,
    Anna agreed to help Jam, recognizing the urgency of the situation.


    Together, they examined the mail that had arrived at City Hall, hoping to find
    a clue that would lead them to the person Papa Legba wanted them to find. Among
    the ordinary letters, one stood out: a plain, cream-colored envelope with a wax
    seal depicting a wolf or a dog. As Anna opened the envelope, a cloud of multicolored
    glitter erupted, momentarily blinding them. Beneath the glitter, they found a
    tiny, intricately carved wooden doll, cold to the touch but strangely alive. The

    The doll, seemingly imbued with magic, began to rotate, pointing in a specific
    direction. Anna, recognizing the doll''s significance, instructed Jam to follow
    its lead, believing that it might lead him to Charlaine and Krabat. Jam, armed
    with the doll and a glimmer of hope, set out into the unknown, following the doll''s
    guidance, hoping to bring his missing colleagues back home.'

  snippet: that only happened with me. The doll, the copy, it smiled. A real smile,
    not the creepy, frozen grimace of a wax figure. Then it waved at me, a quick little
    gesture that somehow was too familiar. It started running. Not a normal run, either.
    Clumsy, awkward. Like it was trying to make noise. "Charlaine, stay here. Stay
    hidden." I didn't need to tell her twice. She was frozen, eyes wide. Like a deer
    in headlights. Or a bunny caught in a snare. The doll ran through the underbrush,
    creating a rustling, cracking symphony. A diversion. A cheap one, but a diversion
    nonetheless. I had planned on setting this whole thing off myself. Get a few of
    the guards chasing after me, give Charlaine time to escape. But that plan went
    south faster than a greased pig. The guards were shouting in the distance. They
    were buying it. The doll was making a hell of a racket. "Let's go." I motioned
    to Charlaine. She was still frozen, so I grabbed her arm and pulled her along.
    We crept back through the woods, the darkness a welcome shroud. I didn't dare
    turn on a flashlight. Not with those guards out there. Not with the Murder Twins
    on our trail. The forest was thick with shadows, the air thick with the scent
    of pine needles and damp earth. I was aware of every rustle, every creak, every
    snapping twig. Paranoia was a familiar companion. I was always on edge, always
    looking over my shoulder. How I missed the city noises of Shadow Falls. We reached
    the edge of the forest. The open field stretched before us, bathed in the pale
    light of the moon. My car was parked at the far end, a dark silhouette against
    the silver sky. We made a run for it. I threw the car door open, a sigh escaping
    my lips. I was glad to be out of that forest. Glad to be back in the familiar
    confines of my car. Glad to be getting the hell out of there. "Jam?" Charlaine's
    voice was shaky. "What was that? What was that doll?" "It was a tool. A way to
    locate you when I had no other clue to go by," I muttered, starting the car. "And
    apparently also a way to buy us some time." "But... why?" "Why did the chicken
    cross the road, Charlaine?" I shrugged. "I don't know. But I'm sure it had a good
    reason. We should stop by your grandma's place, she can probably help make sense
    of this." I gunned the engine, tires spitting gravel as I pulled onto the road.
    We sped down the empty highway, the dark forest shrinking in the rearview mirror.
    I glanced at Charlaine. Her face was pale, her eyes filled with a mixture of fear
    and confusion. "This was a bad day, Jam," she whispered. "It could have been worse,"
    I said, turning the corner onto Maple Lane. "At least, we're out of the woods
    now."

    \nThe night air outside was sweet and crisp, a welcome contrast to the musty stench\
    \ of the underground chamber. Relief washed over Jam, but it was short-lived.\
    \ He heard a car approaching. It was a black sedan, like the one that had taken\
    \ Krabat away earlier. \"We gotta move,\" Jam said, grabbing Charlaine's arm.\
    \ \"They\u2019re coming back.\" Jam pushed her towards the clearing, his eyes\
    \ scanning the darkness for any sign of movement. He could make out the shapes\
    \ of trees, their branches twisting and turning in the wind. The underbrush, that's\
    \ where they needed to go! The sedan pulled up beside an old oak, its headlights\
    \ cutting through the darkness. Several figures emerged from the vehicle. One\
    \ of them was a familiar face, one of the twins, the ones that had been guarding\
    \ the entrance. The other figure was still in shadow, but Jam suspected the face\
    \ would be the same. \"Shit,\" Jam muttered. \"One of them got away during the\
    \ fight. Must've called for reinforcements.\" Charlaine shifted nervously. \"\
    They\u2019re here for me?\" \"Not just for you, kiddo,\" Jam said, his voice gruff.\
    \ The black sedan idled, its engine humming like a caged beast. Two of the murder\
    \ twins stood silhouetted against the headlights, waiting. The tension was mounting,\
    \ a silent pressure building in the air. Jam's hand went to his pistol, the familiar\
    \ weight of metal reassuring. \"We have to leave. And we have to make sure they\
    \ don't follow.\" Jam grabbed Charlaine's arm, pulling her towards the path he\
    \ came from earlier. The woods were dark and dense, offering some cover. They\
    \ pushed through bushes, adrenaline pumping. There were voices behind them. Their\
    \ pursuers. They were relentless, like dogs on the hunt, making noise to flush\
    \ out their prey. Meaning, them. The sound of their pursuers grew closer. Charlaine\
    \ stumbled in the dark, her legs still shaky from confinement. \"Keep moving,\"\
    \ Jam growled, urging her on. Still, Jam knew they couldn't outrun them for long.\
    \ They dodged between the trees, the twins hot on their heels. The sound of their\
    \ footsteps echoed through the woods, a relentless drumbeat. A slight rise in\
    \ the ground appeared ahead, and Jam spotted a large, fallen log lying half-submerged\
    \ in the foilage. It looked like a good hiding spot. Jam pulled Charlaine behind\
    \ the log, their bodies pressed tight against the damp wood. The air was thick\
    \ with the scent of pine and damp earth. \"What now?\" Charlaine whispered. \"\
    We gotta split up,\" Jam said, his voice low and urgent. \"I'll create a distraction,\
    \ you keep going. Head south, follow the path, it'll lead you to my car.\" Charlaine's\
    \ eyes widened. \"No. I'm not leaving you.\" \"You gotta,\" Jam said, shoving\
    \ the car keys into her hand. \"You can escape.\" She looked at him, her eyes\
    \ filled with concern. \"But what if they catch you?\" \"I'll be fine,\" Jam said,\
    \ his voice a little strained. \"It's night, and the woods are cool and damp.\
    \ They can't hurt me unless they brought a flamethrower along\" \"Or the right\
    \ kind of magic, Jam. You're not immune to that.\" Jam grabbed her arm, pulling\
    \ her close. \"No time for that now. You gotta go.\" With a swift motion, Jam\
    \ grabbed a rock and threw it into the darkness. The sound of the rock hitting\
    \ the ground echoed across the clearing. It was a gamble, but it was his best\
    \ bet. Jam closed his eyes and listened. The voices were getting louder; they\
    \ were coming. With a surge of adrenaline, Jam took a few steps back, his hand\
    \ resting on the gun in his pocket. Then, he felt it. A sudden heat in his pocket.\
    \ His hand reached in to find the source. The compass, the one with the little\
    \ \"Charlaine\" doll attached, was emitting a faint glow. Jam had never seen it\
    \ do that before. Charlaine\u2019s voice cut through the air, a little panicked.\
    \ \"What\u2019s wrong, Jam?\" Jam was too stunned to answer. He just held the\
    \ petri dish up in front of him. The doll was no longer a simple wooden carving.\
    \ The small figure was illuminated by a soft, ethereal glow. A strange inscription\
    \ in a language unknown to Jam, was now etched onto the doll's tiny chest. Also,\
    \ its legs seemed to be wiggling. What the hell was this? Charlaine\u2019s face\
    \ was a mask of fear and surprise. \"Where did you get this?\" she asked, her\
    \ voice shaky. Before Jam could answer, she snatched the doll out of his hand,\
    \ throwing it away from them. For a moment, nothing happened. Then the glow from\
    \ the doll turned into a blinding light. Jam shielded his eyes, the heat of the\
    \ light scorching his clay skin. When he looked back at the spot where the doll\
    \ had landed, his jaw dropped. There, standing in the light, was Charlaine. A\
    \ perfect, life-sized copy of her. The same dirt stains on her jeans. The same\
    \ bruises on her arm. The real Charlaine was staring at her copy, her face a mix\
    \ of horror and disbelief. The copy just stood, silent and motionless, a perfect\
    \ replica in every way, but with the same lifeless eyes as a wax figure. This\
    \ was the kind of mess that only happened in Shadow Falls. This was the kind of\
    \ mess that only happened with Jam. The doll, the copy, it smiled. A real smile,\
    \ not the creepy, frozen grimace of a wax figure. Then it waved at Jam, a quick\
    \ little gesture that somehow was too familiar. It started running. Not a normal\
    \ run, either. Clumsy, awkward. Like it was trying to make noise. \"Charlaine,\

  snippet: "my spine. \"Grandma?\" Charlaine\u2019s voice was barely a whisper. Mama\
    \ Marie just smiled, that same unsettling smile that usually meant trouble was\
    \ brewing. \"Don't you worry none, sugarplum. Gran\u2019mere\u2019s got you.\"\
    \ She reached into the folds of her dress and pulled out a small, embroidered\
    \ pouch. Inside, I caught a glimpse of dried herbs, chicken bones, and something\
    \ that looked suspiciously like a human tooth. \"Whenever I ain't sure which way\
    \ the spirits blowin',\" she said, her voice low and rhythmic, \"I consult the\
    \ leaves.\" She tipped the teapot, pouring the last of the murky brew into the\
    \ teacups. Three soggy leaves clung to the bottom. \"Alright, Mama Marie, what\
    \ kinda carnival trick is this?\" Charlaine's foot connected with my shin under\
    \ the table. I shut up. Mama Marie just chuckled, her gold tooth glinting in the\
    \ lamplight. \"Sheriff, you been around long enough to know better than to scoff\
    \ at old ways.\" Her eyes, though, were on Charlaine. \"Child, you seein' somethin'\
    \ in those leaves?\" Charlaine leaned forward, brow furrowed. I knew that look.\
    \ She was tapping into that part of her, the part that saw things I never could.\
    \ \"Grandma,\" she said, voice hushed, \"These leaves... they're a way to talk\
    \ to him, aren't they? To Legba.\" \"Clever girl,\" Mama Marie said, a hint of\
    \ pride in her voice. \"You think those fancy charms and powders gonna reach a\
    \ Loa in the spirit real? Nah, you gotta speak their language.\" \"And this swamp\
    \ water is it?\" I muttered. Another swift kick from Charlaine. \"Hush, Jam,\"\
    \ Mama Marie said, but there was amusement in her eyes. \"The tea, the leaves,\
    \ it's all just focusin'. Openin' the door a crack. Legba, he's got his ears to\
    \ the ground. He'll hear.\" \"Fine,\" I sighed, rubbing my shin. \"But if we end\
    \ up running into Samedi instead, you'all are on your own.\" Charlaine just rolled\
    \ her eyes. \"Like you ever let me out of your sight on a case. Even if the lord\
    \ of the dead himself appears.\" Mama Marie chuckled, a low rumble in her chest.\
    \ \"You two, always squabblin' like pups.\" She carefully poured the remaining\
    \ tea from the pot into a chipped saucer. The murky liquid pooled around the three\
    \ soggy leaves. \"Now hush, both of you. Time to listen.\" The room seemed to\
    \ hold its breath. Shadows stretched from the corners, the air thick with incense\
    \ and something older, earthier. Mama Marie began to chant, low and rhythmic,\
    \ words I didn't understand but felt in my metaphorical bones. The leaves in the\
    \ saucer trembled, spinning slowly at first, then faster, a miniature whirlpool\
    \ in the heart of our little table. The air crackled. A gust of wind slammed the\
    \ windows shut, even though they were already latched tight. Cerberus started\
    \ to howl from his spot underneath the porch. Charlaine stiffened beside me, hand\

  snippet: been returned safely," Legba purred. "Are you prepared to fulfill your
    part of our bargain?" Marie nodded once, chin held high. It happened faster than
    I could blink. Legba lunged, Anna's fangs sinking deep into Marie's throat. Charlaine
    screamed. I lurched forward, my clay limbs sluggish. Too slow. Always too damn
    slow. Marie's eyes rolled back. Her body went limp. Legba drank deep, greedy gulps
    echoing in the candlelit room. "Stop!" I bellowed. Legba's stolen eyes flicked
    to me. Amused. Challenging. Blood trickled from Anna's chin. I grabbed for my
    gun. Useless. What good were bullets against a god? Charlaine's hand shot out,
    gripping my arm. "Don't," she hissed. "You'll make it worse." The hut creaked.
    Shadows danced. Outside, Cerberus howled, low and mournful. Legba released Marie.
    Her body crumpled to the floor. Charlaine rushed to her side, fingers pressed
    to her grandmother's neck. "You bastard," I growled. Legba wiped Anna's mouth
    with the back of her hand. "A deal's a deal, Sheriff. You of all people should
    appreciate that." I clenched my fists. Clay cracked and reformed. "This wasn't
    part of it." "Wasn't it?" Legba's stolen voice dripped honey and poison. "The
    price at the crossroads, remember? Everything has a cost. Mama Marie knew, and
    she gladly paid to keep her family safe." Charlaine's voice, barely a whisper.
    "She's gone." Legba stretched, catlike, in Anna's body. "Now, now. Don't look
    so glum. Nosferatu, remember? She'll be back... in a way." "As a bloody vampire?"
    I snarled. That damned smile again. "You'll see soon enough. Tick tock, Sheriff.
    Best hurry to city hall." Thunder rumbled outside. The air crackled, heavy with
    ozone and something darker. "Oh, and Slate?" Legba's eyes glittered. "You might
    want to bring your map." A blinding flash. When my vision cleared, Anna's body
    lay crumpled on the floor. No sign of Legba. I looked at Marie, pale and still.
    At Anna, unconscious and vulnerable. At Charlaine, eyes wide with panic. The clock
    on the wall ticked steadily. Thirty minutes to sunrise. Tears ran down Charlaine's
    face, but her voice was calm and steady. "Jam. We need to go. Now." "Cerberus,"
    I called. The hound's massive head appeared in the doorway. "Guard them. All three."
    Charlaine stood, shoulders squared. "I'm coming with you." "Like hell you are,"
    I growled. "My grandmother is dead," she snapped. "Anna's out cold. Whoever wakes
    up first might be... hungry." I opened my mouth to argue. Closed it. The kid had
    a point. "Fine," I grunted. "But you follow my lead." We stepped out into the
    storm-dark day. Thunder rolled across the sky. The air smelled of rain and burning
    rubber. I stared at what was left of my car. "Guess we know now where the explosion
    was coming from." I checked the clock again. Twenty-five minutes left. Whatever
    Legba had set in motion, we were racing against the clock. We'd have to run to
    make it in time. The day had barely started and was already getting crappier by
    the minute.

    \ Jam to go to city hall before dawn and bring the map they had found in the cabin.\n\
    \nBefore Jam could argue, Papa Legba turned to Mama Marie, who, with a calm resignation,\
    \ agreed to fulfill her part of the bargain. In a swift and shocking move, Papa\
    \ Legba lunged at Mama Marie, sinking his fangs into her throat. Charlaine screamed,\
    \ and Jam, too slow to intervene, watched in horror as Papa Legba drained Mama\
    \ Marie of her life force. He then released her lifeless body, leaving Charlaine\
    \ to mourn her grandmother's death. Papa Legba, unfazed by Jam's anger, justified\
    \ his actions by stating that Mama Marie had willingly paid the price to keep\
    \ her family safe. He then revealed that Mama Marie would be back, but as a vampire.\
    \ With a blinding flash, Papa Legba vanished, leaving behind Anna's unconscious\
    \ body.\n\nJam, realizing the urgency of the situation, urged Charlaine to leave\
    \ with him, as Anna might wake up and become a threat. They left the hut, with\
    \ Cerberus guarding the unconscious Anna and Mama Marie's body. As they stepped\
    \ out into the storm-dark day, Jam noticed that his car had been destroyed, likely\
    \ by the explosion that had occurred earlier. With only twenty-five minutes left\
    \ before sunrise, they raced against the clock, knowing that whatever Papa Legba\
    \ had set in motion, they had to act quickly. The day had barely started and was\
    \ already getting crappier by the minute."
