I walked out of the bar, the night air thick with the smell of pine and damp earth. The streetlights cast long shadows, stretching out like grasping fingers. I knew I should head back to the station, but my gut was churning. I needed to see the storage unit, the place where the latest victim had been found. It was a long shot, but I had to try.

The "Main Street Mini Storage" was a squat, concrete building, tucked away on the edge of town. The metal doors were all locked, the only sound the wind whistling through the gaps. I pulled out my keys, the metal cold against my palm. I had a key for every storage unit in town, a perk of being the sheriff. I found the unit number, a simple metal tag hanging from the door. I unlocked it, the rusty hinges groaning in protest.

The interior was dark, the air stale and dusty. A single bare bulb hung from the ceiling, casting a dim yellow glow. The unit was empty, the only evidence of the crime scene a faint trace of blood on the concrete floor. The coroner had already taken the body, and Charlaine had told me any magic trail would run cold after two to three hours anyway. But she was gone, and I had no better idea where to look.

I ran my hand over the cold concrete, feeling the rough texture beneath my fingers. I could almost see the victim, lying there, lifeless, the blood staining the floor. I closed my eyes, trying to picture the scene, to feel the energy that had been present. But there was nothing. Just emptiness.

I turned to leave, the weight of the unsolved case pressing down on me. I had a bad feeling about this. A feeling that something was wrong, something was missing. I needed to find Charlaine, and I needed to find out what Krabat was up to. This town was a powder keg, and I was the only one holding the fuse.

I pushed the door open, ignoring the yellow police tape I'd strung up earlier. The storage unit was dark, the air thick with dust and the unsettling quiet of a place where life had been abruptly cut short. The single bare bulb cast a sickly yellow glow, highlighting the grime on the concrete floor. Everything was just as I'd left it. The faint trace of blood, the overturned box, the lingering scent of fear. 

I walked over to the spot where the body had been found, the memory of the victim's face flashing in my mind. Frankie, a kid barely out of his teens, with a mop of unruly brown hair and a nervous smile. He'd been working here, trying to make a few bucks, when he'd stumbled upon something he shouldn't have. 

I ran a hand over the cold concrete, the rough texture familiar beneath my fingers. I'd seen too many of these scenes, too many lives cut short. I never understood the logic, the reasoning behind the choices. Why Frankie? Why this place? Why now? The killer had left no clues, no motive, just a trail of blood and unanswered questions.

The air in the storage unit felt heavy, like a shroud draped over the whole damn place. I ran a hand through my hair, frustration gnawing at me. Another dead end. Another case with more questions than answers. I crouched down, examining the dusty concrete. The faint trace of blood, a smear of crimson against the gray, was almost invisible in the dim light. But something else caught my eye. A faint scratch, barely visible, hidden beneath the blood. It was almost imperceptible, like a whisper in the silence. I traced the line with my finger, feeling a prickle of unease. It wasn't a random scratch. It was deliberate, precise. A mark left by something, or someone. I stood up, my gut twisting. This wasn't just a random killing. This was something else. Something darker, something more sinister.

I knelt down again, brushing away the dust and blood with my sleeve. The scratch was deeper than I first thought, a groove carved into the concrete. I ran my fingers along it, feeling the rough texture. It wasn't a random scratch. It was deliberate, precise. A mark left by something, or someone. I wiped away the rest of the blood, revealing a faint inscription etched into the concrete. It was a series of symbols, swirling and intricate, like a spiderweb woven from moonlight. I didn't recognize them, but they resonated with a subtle energy, a hum that vibrated beneath my skin. I pulled out my phone and snapped a picture.  "Charlaine," I called out, "Get down here. I found something."

Charlaine came bounding down the stairs, her curls bouncing with each step. She stopped short, her eyes widening as she saw the inscription. "What is that?" she whispered, her voice barely a breath.

I shrugged, my own voice a low rumble. "Don't know. But it's not good."

I traced the inscription with my finger, the energy buzzing beneath my skin. A jolt shot through me, and the inscription glowed with an eerie blue light. The air crackled, and a shimmering circle materialized on the floor where the inscription was etched.

Charlaine gasped, her hand flying to her mouth. "What's happening?"

I didn't have an answer. I just stared at the circle, the energy swirling within it, growing stronger with each passing second. It felt like a portal, a gateway to something else. Something dark.

"Jam?" Charlaine's voice was a shaky whisper. "What do we do?"

I didn't know. I didn't know what this was, or what it wanted. But I knew one thing: it wasn't good.

I leaped back, my heart pounding like a drum solo in a cheap honky-tonk. The warehouse plunged into an unnatural darkness within the circle. It wasn't the kind of darkness you get from a power outage, the kind that makes you stumble around, bumping into things. This was a darkness that sucked the light out of the air, leaving a cold, empty void. A low growl echoed from the darkness, sending shivers down my spine. It was a sound that spoke of hunger, of ancient malice. 

Charlaine was frozen, her eyes wide with fear. "Jam?" she whispered, her voice barely audible over the growl. "What is it?"

I didn't know. I didn't know what was coming out of that circle, but I knew it wasn't something I wanted to meet face-to-face. "Get back," I growled, my voice a low rumble. "Get back and stay there."

She didn't move. She just stood there, her eyes fixed on the circle, her hand clutching the worn leather pouch that held her grandmother's "kit." I knew she was trying to be brave, but the fear in her eyes was a dead giveaway. 

The growl grew louder, closer. The darkness within the circle pulsed, like a heart beating in the chest of a monster. I could feel the energy, the raw power, radiating from it. It was a force I'd never encountered before, something ancient and evil. 

I took a step forward, my hand instinctively reaching for my gun. I knew it wouldn't do much against whatever was coming out of that circle, but it was all I had. 

The darkness shifted, and a pair of glowing red eyes appeared within the circle. They were like burning coals, reflecting the fear in my gut. 

"Jam," Charlaine whispered, her voice barely a breath. "What do we do?"

I didn't know. I didn't know what to do. But I knew one thing: I had to protect her. I had to protect Shadow Falls.

My hand tightened around the revolver, the cold metal a comfort in the face of the unknown. The red eyes burned brighter, and the darkness within the circle churned, like a cauldron bubbling over. I knew bullets wouldn't stop whatever was coming out of that mess, but it was all I had.  "Stay back," I growled, my voice a low rumble. Charlaine didn't move. She just stood there, her eyes fixed on the circle, her hand still clutching that damn pouch.  The growl came again, closer this time, a guttural rasp that sent shivers down my spine. The air crackled with energy, the kind that made your hair stand on end.  I took another step forward, my gun aimed at the swirling shadows.  "Jam," Charlaine whispered, her voice barely audible over the growl. "What is it?"  I didn't know. I didn't know what was coming out of that circle, but I knew it wasn't something I wanted to meet face-to-face.  The darkness shifted, and a figure emerged from the circle. It was tall and lean, with piercing black eyes and a shock of white hair that seemed to defy gravity.  Krabat.  "Well, well, well," he said, his voice a smooth, dangerous whisper. "Look who's come to play."  I didn't answer. I just kept my gun trained on him.  "You know," he continued, his eyes never leaving mine, "I've always admired your dedication to this town. You're a good cop, Jam. A damn good cop."  He took a step forward, his smile widening. "But even the best cops can't stop everything."  He reached into his coat pocket and pulled out a small, ornate box.  "This," he said, his voice dropping to a low growl, "is going to change everything."  He opened the box, and a wave of cold, dark energy washed over me.  I knew then that this wasn't just another case. This was something bigger, something that could change Shadow Falls forever.  And I was about to be caught in the middle of it.
