Charlaine was hunched over her files, eyes narrowed, lips pursed in concentration. I nodded at her. She glanced up and gave me a tired smile, "You're back." Her voice was flat, weary. "Yeah, back." I dropped into the chair behind the cluttered desk. "How much did you manage to find out about the twins?" "Nothing," Charlaine replied, pulling a pack of chewing gum from her bag. "They seem to have vanished into thin air." I snorted. "You could say that again. Just like our killer, who, by the way, might not be one after all." "What?" She looked up, eyebrows furrowed. "Two identical twins? How did they even-" I cut her off, "That's not all. Someone else was there. Someone with a touch of magic." I stared at the pot of black, lukewarm coffee. I needed caffeine, a whole damn pot of it. My throat was dryer than the Arizona desert and my clay was still stiff from the heat. I grabbed the pot and chugged it in one go. I could feel the liquid coursing through my system, loosening my joints and pushing back the exhaustion.  I slammed the pot down on the desk, making the old phone ring. "Looks like we're dealing with a mage." "A mage?" Charlaine's eyes widened. She looked at me, then at the pot, then back at me.  "Well, good thing you're a goddamn golem." She chewed her gum, her eyes suddenly thoughtful. "They're not the first ones to try this, you know. The old city's got a bad habit of attracting trouble." I looked at Charlaine, trying to figure out what she was talking about. She tossed a handful of gum wrappers in the wastebasket and leaned back in her chair. "There was an old story about a coven of witches. They wanted to use Shadow Falls as their base of operations.  Jam was just a babe at the time but the locals managed to banish them. They were never seen again."  "The twins..."  "They might be witches," Charlaine said. "The coven's descendants or something. Or maybe they're just pawns for someone else. It wouldn't be the first time." "Damn it." I pushed back from the desk, my legs shaky.  I needed more coffee.  "Looks like we're about to learn a lot more about our little town than either of us bargained for." I tossed my coffee mug into the wastebasket and took a deep breath. "Maybe this town's secrets aren't as buried as we thought." I glanced at Charlaine, her eyes narrowed. "Let's start with the twins. Find out who they are, what they're doing here. And then we'll see what else we can dig up." She nodded, a grim look on her face. "I'll get started right away." I took a step back. "I'll make sure the coffee pot stays full." She looked up, a flicker of amusement in her eyes. "Good. You'll need it. We're in for a long night."  I sighed.  I wished I could smoke.

"Get your kit," I told Charlaine. "We're gonna have a little chat with the supernatural." 

She looked up at me, puzzled. "The kit?"

"Yeah, the kit," I said. "You know, the one your grandma gave you." 

"You mean the fingerprinting kit?"

I snorted. "No, Charlaine. I don't mean the fingerprinting kit. I mean the one with all the voodoo trinkets and the weird herbs. The one you use for sniffing out the magic."

She rolled her eyes. "Oh, that kit. Why didn't you just say so?" 

"You know I don't have time for all your voodoo shenanigans," I said, picking up the coffee pot. "But looks like we're about to have a real-life spooky movie." 

"Don't be so dramatic," she said. "I wouldn't be calling on Papa Legba." 

"Well, good. He's a creepy dude." 

She smirked, "More like something for Grand-MÃ¨re. I leave that sort of stuff to her."

"You're a real piece of work," I said, handing the coffee pot back to Charlaine. "Don't let the door hit you on the way out. Or in." She just laughed and walked out. The moment she was gone, Anna's voice crackled out of the speaker. "Jam. I need you in my office. Now." I sighed. I was about to get my caffeine fix, but the mayor always knew how to make a guy feel like he was back in high school. I looked in the mirror on the wall. I didn't need to shave, the beard was just part of the look. I rubbed my eyes and straightened my hat.  "Looks like somebody needs her daily dose of sheriff," I muttered. I could hear Charlaine giggling from outside the door. "Go ahead," she said. "Have fun. Tell her I said hi." I just grunted and turned toward the door. "You know, being insubordinate is a fireable offense," I said, trying to be threatening. "Love you too, Jam," she said, and then I was out the door.

Anna's office was a mess. Papers piled everywhere, medical journals mixed with coffee cups and empty pill bottles. The smell of antiseptic and stale coffee hung in the air. I stepped in and leaned against the desk. I needed a seat. I watched as Anna struggled to get comfortable in her chair, which was covered in a thick layer of medical supplies. 

"You smell like garlic," she said, coughing.

"Oh," I said sheepishly, "I carry a clove in a ziploc bag. In case I need to break up a bar fight at the Fangs and Fur."

"You know, that would be quite the sight," she said, a hint of amusement in her voice. "A golem sheriff with a clove of garlic."

"Yeah, well, one of those bullets must have nicked the plastic. Now the smell is streaming out. I should have changed the bag this morning."

"So, how's the investigation going?"  She looked up from the mountain of papers, her eyes red and tired.  

"Well, the twins, they're gone. Vanished. Poof. Like magic."  I looked around the office.  "Speaking of, this seems to be the first sign of non-human elements involved.  Complicates things."  I pulled out the crumpled ziploc bag from my pocket.  "You know, these things aren't cheap, you'd think they could make them bulletproof."  Anna sighed and nodded.

"Rules are rules, Jam," she said. "You've been ignoring them for long enough."  I shrugged. "Just trying to do my job, Anna. Keep the town safe." "You think you can do that alone now? Magic's involved. I'm calling in some backup." I took a deep breath. "Fine. But this town's been quiet for a hundred years, maybe you should've warned me about this magic thing before I signed up for this job." She just stared at me, then spoke softly. "You know, I could've used you in a bar fight or two, back in the day. You're good at calming things down." I wasn't sure if that was a jab or a compliment.  "Just call the Bureau, Anna. We'll deal with it."

"Bureau's gonna be here soon. Probably gonna tear the whole place apart."
"They'll mess things up," Anna sighed. "And they'll take all the credit. Do you really want them here?" 
"You know I hate it when they're here," I said. "Especially when they're all 'we need to question the suspect'."
"But they're good at their job, Jam. We need their experience."
"Yeah, well, I've got my own experience. And I'd rather solve this myself." 
"You need more than experience, Jam. You need help." Anna was getting impatient. "And yes, we'll need to call Krabat. No, he's not my 'Igor', I swear. He's just helping me with some research." 
"Alright, alright, Anna. Just don't let him turn us all into werewolves."
Anna just shook her head. "I'll tell you what, you go back to the station and I'll start making some calls. You have a hunch about these twins? Anything at all?"
"Got a feeling," I replied, "but I ain't sharing it with those goons in suits. It's gotta be me, Anna. It's always gotta be me." 
I stood up and headed for the door. "Don't let those suits ruin everything, Anna. You know how it is."  
"I do." She looked at me with a mixture of resignation and hope. "Keep me posted, alright, Jam?" 
I nodded. I knew I could count on her.  
"You got it, Anna." 
I left the office, that damn clove of garlic still leaking its stink. I took a sip of coffee and grimaced.  Needed another pot.  Needed a cigarette.  Needed a goddamn break. But Shadow Falls was never gonna let me have one.

"Couple of days, tops, before they show up," I said, "We gotta work fast. " 
Anna stared at me, her gaze steady. "We've got to," she said, "You know the town's paid a lot for legal fees, to prevent something like that from happening again. We won't let them take you away."  
I nodded. "I know," I said, "Thanks, Anna. I know. "
Anna knew that by "the town" she meant her. She'd been funding Shadow Falls' legal battles ever since I'd been sheriff. Without her, this place would be as broke as a two-bit gambler.

I was already halfway out the door, heading back to my office. "Let's go, Charlaine," I said, grabbing my hat from the rack. 

Charlaine was already packed up and waiting. "Ready when you are, Jam." she said. "And for the record, you're gonna be one stinky sheriff if you don't get that garlic smell off of you." 

I snorted, "Got it. " The only problem was that the damn smell seemed to be stuck on me like a bad case of the flu. And I had a feeling this smell would stay with me for the whole day.

She had another pot of coffee going. "You gonna finish that?" she asked. 

I nodded, "Damn right. I'm gonna need it." I downed it, the caffeine giving me a boost. 

We stepped out into the hallway and back into the business of Shadow Falls. The case wasn't even a day old and it was already getting complicated.  The air was thick with the smell of rain, a scent that was as familiar to me as the back of my hand.  "Let's go," I said, taking a deep breath of the damp air, "It's time to see what we're dealing with."
