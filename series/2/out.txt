Charlaine looked up from a stack of paperwork, her face creased with worry. "You alright, Jam?"

"Fine as a frog, doll," I mumbled, eyes glazed with exhaustion. "Just a little dehydrated, that's all." I poured myself another cup of the black, bitter nectar. A million miles of dirt road and scorching sun, a lifetime of chasing criminals on a full stomach: It wouldn't do me any favors.

"You're worse than usual, even for summer." Charlaine's eyes tracked me as I tipped back my head, draining the mug. It went down easy and hit my core fast. You know the expression "your bones ache from the cold"? This was the reverse. My bones, or what I considered bones anyway, were crying for liquid. 

The town's secret was out. A magician had teleported my little murderers, and not even the police had any right to their presence on this side of the law.  My eyes darted to the old inter-office speaker hanging on the wall above my desk. My gaze lingered for a second on the Mayor's old microphone. It seemed that the only other person in this town who could bring me any answers, right now, was Dr. Anna Arborio, and I couldn't stand to deal with the headache that came with her questions.

“Get me your kit,” I said, grabbing a second cup of coffee, “This one’s for real. And try to not look like your grand-mère taught you, doll.” Charlaine raised an eyebrow, her eyes darting between me and the old wooden cupboard where she kept “her kit,” a collection of potions and artifacts I’d grown accustomed to calling “Voodoo crap,” though it was, at least, practical.  "That stuff’s for your grandma.  We're not talking to Papa Legba."

“Right,” I told her, getting up from my seat, “If she’s calling me over… that means trouble.” Charlaine just shrugged, heading toward the closet with the magical tools. “She just needs your clay fix.” 

My phone started to ring. “If it’s Anna,” I said, “Tell her to wait,”  

I took out the phone and realized it was the station's line, and the dispatcher sounded frantic, “Sheriff? There's another one down at the corner of Elm and Pine!”  “Is it another missing person?" 

“No, Sir. A dead one. This one’s…" She took a breath, “I don't think they’ll make the 10 O'clock news. This one is…" 

“Go on, spit it out.” I was impatient, she could practically smell the blood all the way from my phone. “Don’t beat around the bush." 

"Sir. Looks like another missing twin," She whispered the words, almost reverently.  “Another victim… for our serial killer." I ran my hand through my short-cropped hair. I’d forgotten about my need for water and my clay had started to stiffen. 
"Tell the boys to secure the scene,” I said, finally remembering to add, “You need more water now?” I glanced at the deputy, “Can’t afford for you to go brittle, either.”

Anna’s office smelled of old medicine, dust and, inexplicably, coffee. I walked over to the desk. The old inter-office intercom was humming. Her desk was a mess, all files and medical instruments and papers with writing in all kinds of languages: I didn't want to find out what she was studying on that desk at this moment. 
She started to cough. “Jam. You stink of garlic.”
“Sorry, Anna.” I felt a blush crawl up my neck. The clove of garlic I usually carried with me had somehow fallen into the pocket of my jeans. One of those bullets from this afternoon had to have ripped the plastic, and now my scent had been permeating my surroundings. “Got it out of a ziploc. You know. Sometimes you never know when you might need it. A bar fight at the Fangs and Fur… it can be rough.” 
She narrowed her eyes. “That’s no excuse, Sheriff. What are we going to do now?" 
“Yeah, we gotta find this mage first, Anna.”

“So you think there’s magic in the air, huh?” she asked. Her sunglasses caught the sunlight streaming through the window and turned them into two black orbs, staring me down.  
I sat down and ran my hands over the worn surface of the desk, the wood cracked and weathered with years of use, the scent of aging ink still lingering in the air.  "Something’s changed," I told her.  "It's like... the walls of the city are thin now. Everything's coming out. Maybe that’s why the cops never saw him. These killer twins, they walked right through, like... smoke." She stared out the window, the sunlight reflecting off the metal rim of her sunglasses. “Right,” Anna said. “And it's convenient they didn’t notice anything.”
“Anna,” I said, my voice a low rumble, a slow echo that resonated in the room, “Those kids, they weren't human.” I told her everything about the abandoned basement and the bullets I found in my body, and how I was left drained, thirsty and, more importantly, without a trace of the killer twins. I watched her take the sunglasses off and finally looked at me, her gaze filled with suspicion, her red-rimmed eyes sharp as knives. “But who are they?” I said, reaching for a dusty box of cigarettes that were more for show than anything. “That’s what we gotta find out." I lit one up and the smell of stale tobacco drifted towards Anna. I knew it didn't bother her much but still tried not to light up close to her. It was out of habit and because she's more fragile than she wants to appear.

"I'm not so sure it’s gonna help," I muttered, taking another drag of my cigarette. I could feel the familiar itch at the back of my throat but ignored it, the nicotine never affecting me as much as I’d like. Anna tapped her finger on the table. "The city's got rules," she said, “and if we’re talking magic, we need to be prepared. You might not like it, Jam, but that includes calling in outsiders. I can’t ignore this any longer.” The mention of ‘outsiders’ hit a sour note. Bringing in new cops would mean bringing new problems. The more I think about it, the more I wished it was just a simple string of murders. But then, magic always does a way of turning your life upside down. I felt a wave of exhaustion sweep over me, the heat from the summer sun pounding through the windowpane and adding another layer of misery to my already tense day.

"Fine, but if they get here," I said, taking a final drag from my cigarette, "we need to be ahead of the curve. I don't want some guy in a suit and sunglasses screwing up evidence." 

She gave me a hard look.  "Jam, you have no right to accuse Krabat like that,  It's disrespectful.”  

I just looked back. I didn’t mean it to be so harsh. I still get my wires crossed sometimes, I think. “Krabat," I repeated slowly, as if tasting the words. I'd be a fool to disagree, especially after what I saw earlier. "Just think, this time he might even help us track some actual magic.”  Anna took a long drag of her cigarette, "He's helping with research, I won't have anyone call him Igor,"  she said. 
"Right."   I said, not giving her a hard look back this time. "Your Igor," I murmured to myself, my gaze lingering on Anna.

"Yeah, I get it," I told her, looking back at her. Two days tops before the suits and sunglasses show up. I gotta find out what I can before that. "This town put a lotta money into lawyers just so we could keep a Sheriff," she said. "Don't worry, it won't happen again."  "No worries," I said, trying to act indifferent. Truth was, she was the one paying the legal bills, no doubt about it. Shadow Falls didn’t have a pot to piss in. This place only stayed afloat thanks to Anna Arborio.

The door shut behind me and I felt a chill, the kind that comes not from a draft but from knowing what was waiting outside. “Ready to go, Charlaine?” She was fiddling with a suitcase. My eyes fell on the various little containers inside; a vial filled with clear oil, a handful of wooden twigs, a pouch of sand. “You wouldn’t believe the magic tricks I’ve seen since Grandma gave me this stuff.” "Save it for the seance. "Charlaine gave a quick salute. “Right away, boss.” She shut the suitcase with a snap and followed me out. I let the sun beat down on my face for a minute, savoring the feeling, letting my cracked skin drink in what moisture it could find. “Looks like another summer day in Shadow Falls.” I hoped to catch another drop of lemonade in a shop nearby but Charlaine seemed ready to go. 
"Where to?" She asked. "What are your thoughts? We need to start from somewhere." "From that basement."  We started making our way down towards the place where I’d encountered the killers, down the scorching sidewalks and through the dusty streets. She stopped on a street corner and began rummaging through her suitcase. I let her take her time. I took a few slow breaths to compose myself, the sun making my chest burn. I hoped that the feeling wouldn’t take too long to subside. If this damn city wasn’t in the middle of a goddamn desert, this would all be easier.
