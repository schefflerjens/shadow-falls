The air outside was sweet and crisp, a welcome contrast to the musty air of the underground chamber. Relief washed over me, but it was short-lived. I heard a car approaching. It was a black sedan, the same one that had taken Krabat away earlier. 

"We gotta move," I said, grabbing Charlaine's arm. "They’re coming back." I pushed her towards the clearing, my eyes scanning the darkness for any sign of movement. I could make out the shapes of trees, their branches twisting and turning in the wind. It was a familiar sight, yet it felt alien, like a backdrop to a nightmare. 

We stumbled into the clearing. The sedan pulled up beside the old oak, its headlights cutting through the darkness. I could see two figures emerging from the vehicle. One of them was a familiar face, one of the twins, the ones that had been guarding the entrance.  The other figure was still in shadow, hidden by the darkness of the car. 

"Shit," I muttered. "One of them got away."

Charlaine shifted nervously. "They’re here for me?"

"Not just for you, kiddo," I said, my voice gruff. "They're here for whatever they think you know. Whatever Krabat was after." My mind raced back to the events of the past few hours, trying to make sense of it all. What had they taken her for? What were they after?

The black sedan idled, the engine humming like a caged beast. The two figures stood silhouetted against the headlights, waiting. I could feel the tension mounting, a silent pressure building in the air. My hand went to my pistol, the familiar weight of metal reassuring.

"We have to get out of here," I said, pulling Charlaine behind me.  "And we have to make sure they don't follow."

And we have to make sure they don't follow. I grabbed Charlaine's arm, pulling her towards the path I came from earlier. The woods were dark and dense, offering some cover. We pushed through bushes, adrenaline pumping. The sound of their pursuers grew closer. Charlaine stumbled at first, her legs shaky from confinement.  "Keep moving," I growled, urging her on.  I knew we couldn't outrun them for long. 

We burst out of the trees and into the clearing. The sedan was parked beside the oak, its headlights still on, illuminating the area.  Six of the Murder Twins were standing in the clearing, all armed to the teeth.  They saw us and started moving towards us, their faces expressionless, their eyes cold and calculating.

"They're all here," Charlaine whispered, her voice trembling. 

"That's not good," I muttered, my grip tightening on my gun. "We gotta make a run for it."

I took off running, Charlaine close behind. We dodged between the trees, the twins hot on our heels. The sound of their footsteps echoed through the woods, a relentless drumbeat.  I could feel the sting of their bullets grazing my back.  They were relentless, like dogs on the hunt. I could hear Charlaine gasping for breath behind me.  We had to reach the path.  It was our only chance.

We broke into the path.  It was narrow and winding, but it was familiar ground.  I knew it like the back of my hand.  We ran for what felt like an eternity.  The sound of our pursuers' footsteps started to fade in the distance.  Finally, we came to a small creek.  We waded in, the icy water chilling us to the bone.  

"They won't follow us in here," I said, my voice hoarse from exertion.  "They're not built for water."

Charlaine nodded, her chest heaving.  She leaned against a tree, trying to catch her breath.  "We made it," she said, her voice weak.

I surveyed the creek.  The darkness made it impossible to see where we were going.  The water was cold, but it wouldn't slow us down.  I pulled Charlaine by the hand.  "We're not out of the woods yet, kiddo.  We gotta keep moving."

I pulled Charlaine by the hand, the creek's chill biting into my bare skin. My clay, usually as tough as iron, felt a little stiff from the prolonged cold. I knew I couldn't stay in the water too long. I needed to find someplace dry, someplace safe.

We pushed onward, the sound of the rushing water a constant roar in my ears. A slight rise in the ground appeared ahead, and I spotted a large, fallen log lying half-submerged in the creek. It looked like a good hiding spot.

I pulled Charlaine behind the log, our bodies pressed tight against the damp wood. The air was thick with the scent of pine and damp earth. The water gurgled against the log, making a soft, rhythmic sound. 

"What now?" Charlaine whispered, her voice barely above a breath.

"We gotta split up," I said, my voice low and urgent. "They're gonna come after us, and we can't outrun them forever."

Charlaine's eyes widened. "But what about you?"

"I'll create a distraction," I said, shoving the gun into her hand. "You keep going. Head south, follow the creek, it'll lead you out of the woods."

"No," she whispered, her voice firm. "I'm not leaving you."

"You gotta," I said, my voice firm. "You're lighter on your feet. You can get away."

She looked at me, her eyes filled with concern. "But what if they get you?"

"I'll be fine," I said, my voice a little strained. "I'm not going anywhere they can catch me." 

I took a deep breath, the cold air stinging my lungs. I needed to buy her some time. 

With a swift motion, I grabbed a rock from the creek bed,  throwing it as far as I could into the darkness. The sound of the rock hitting the water echoed across the clearing. I knew it was a long shot, but it was my best bet.

"I'll be right behind you, Sheriff," Charlaine whispered, her voice filled with defiance.

I grabbed her arm, pulling her close. "No time for that now," I whispered, my voice barely audible above the sound of the rushing water. "You gotta go."

I gave her a quick, hard squeeze, then pushed her towards the creek. "Go, Charlaine!  Go!"

As she disappeared into the darkness, I turned my attention to the creek bank. A sharp crack sounded from the other side.  I knew they were coming. With a surge of adrenaline, I took a few steps back, my hand resting on the gun in my pocket.

Then, I felt it.

A sudden heat in my pocket. I pulled it out, my hand reaching in instinctively. The compass, the one with the little "Charlaine" doll attached, was emitting a faint glow, a light I'd never seen before.

Charlaine’s voice cut through the air, a little panicked. "What’s wrong, Jam?" 

I was too stunned to answer.  I just held the compass up in front of me. The doll was no longer the simple clay I'd bought her in that dusty curio shop. The small figure was illuminated by a soft, ethereal glow. A strange inscription, not even in a language I could recognize, was now etched onto the doll's tiny chest.  

I was looking at the doll, but my mind was racing. 

What the hell is this?

Charlaine’s face was a mask of fear and surprise. "Where did you get this?" she asked, her voice shaky. I couldn't answer. Before I could, she snatched the doll out of my hand, throwing it as far away from her as she could.  For a moment, nothing happened. Then the glow from the doll turned into a blinding light. I shielded my eyes, the heat of the light scorching my skin.  When I looked back at the spot where the doll had landed, my jaw dropped. There, standing in the light, was Charlaine. A perfect, life-sized copy of her. The same dirt stains on her jeans. The same bruises on her arm.  The real Charlaine was staring at her copy, her face a mix of horror and disbelief. The copy just stood there, silent and motionless, a perfect replica in every way, but with the same lifeless eyes as a wax figure.  This was bad. Really bad.  This was the kind of mess that could only happen in Shadow Falls. This was the kind of mess that could only happen with me.

The doll, the copy, it smiled.  A real smile, not the creepy, frozen grimace of a wax figure. Then it waved at me, a quick little gesture that somehow felt too familiar.  It started running.  Not a normal run, either.  Clumsy, awkward.  Like it was trying to make noise. 

"Charlaine, stay here.  Stay hidden." I didn't need to tell her twice.  She was frozen, eyes wide.  Like a deer in headlights.  Or a bunny caught in a snare.  

I watched as the doll ran through the underbrush, creating a rustling, cracking symphony.  A diversion.  A cheap one, but a diversion nonetheless.  

I had planned on setting this whole thing off myself.  Get a few of the guards chasing after me, give Charlaine time to escape.  But that plan went south faster than a greased pig.  

I heard the guard's shouts.  They were buying it.  The doll was making a hell of a racket.  

"Let's go." I motioned to Charlaine.  She was still frozen, so I grabbed her arm and pulled her along.  We crept back through the woods, the darkness a welcome shroud.  I didn't dare turn on a flashlight.  Not with those guards out there.  Not with the Murder Twins on our trail.  

The forest was thick with shadows, the air thick with the scent of pine needles and damp earth.  I was acutely aware of every rustle, every creak, every snapping twig.  Paranoia was a familiar companion.  I was always on edge, always looking over my shoulder, waiting for the other shoe to drop.  

Finally, we reached the edge of the forest.  The open field stretched before us, bathed in the pale light of the moon.  My car was parked at the far end, a dark silhouette against the silver sky.  We made a run for it. 

I threw the car door open, a sigh escaping my lips.  I was glad to be out of that forest.  Glad to be back in the familiar confines of my car.  Glad to be getting the hell out of there.  

"Jam?" Charlaine's voice was shaky.  "What was that?  What was that doll?"  

"It was a diversion.  A bit of a distraction," I muttered, starting the car.  "A way to buy us some time." 

"But... why?"

"Why did the chicken cross the road, Charlaine?"  I shrugged.  "I don't know.  But I'm sure it had a good reason.  Besides, I'm not gonna sit here and explain the intricacies of the Murder Twins' magic to you.  It'll just give you nightmares."  

I gunned the engine, tires spitting gravel as I pulled onto the road.  We sped down the empty highway, the dark forest shrinking in the rearview mirror.  I glanced at Charlaine.  Her face was pale, her eyes filled with a mixture of fear and confusion. 

"This was a bad day, Jam," she whispered. 

"It could have been worse," I said, turning the corner onto Maple Lane.  "Much worse."
