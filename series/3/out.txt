"Nothing here," Charlaine said, her voice a whisper. Her face was pale under the harsh beam of the flashlight, her normally bright eyes wide and wary. "Just more of the same junk."

"No magic left," I added, kicking a piece of rusted metal. The clang echoed through the emptiness, as hollow as my gut. "I figured there might be some kind of clue. Maybe a trace. But this place is cleaner than a nun's chastity belt."

She pulled out a tattered notebook and a pen from her jacket, fiddling with the clasp. I knew that notebook was for her grandmother. "I'm gonna log this." She closed the book. "Just in case."

Charlaine's grandmother was a manbo, a voodoo priestess, and Charlaine had been trained to sense the whispers of the supernatural. It wasn't exactly her forte, but she was damn good at finding little things. Her kit, as I called it, was full of strange trinkets and tools that made our investigations that much more… unique.

"No, I think we're done here," I said, already turning toward the stairs. "This place ain't giving anything up."

As we climbed the stairs, the dank smell of the basement followed us. It clung to my coat, a reminder of the fight, the teleportation, the empty magic. The air felt like it was closing in, smothering. I felt the weight of Shadow Falls on my shoulders. It was a town built on secrets, where the past was always lurking in the shadows. The magic was like an infection, spreading, and I was at the front line, trying to contain it.

"They're gone," I said, more to myself than to Charlaine. "Poof. Just like that."

"They'll be back," Charlaine said, her voice tight with apprehension. "They always come back. Especially when things get… complicated."

"Complicated?" I asked, stopping in the doorway, my shoulders slumping under the weight of the mystery. "What do you mean?"

"Just a hunch," she said, her eyes fixed on the alley, where the shadows danced in the flickering streetlights. "A bad feeling."

I knew she was right. Shadow Falls was always ready to throw a curveball, and this was just the beginning.

"See anything?" I rumbled, my voice low and steady. Charlaine shook her head, her brow furrowed in concentration. Unlike me, she wasn't relying solely on sight. Reaching into a worn pouch on her belt, she fished out a vial filled with shimmering dust; a pale lavender that seemed to glow faintly even in the dim light. With a muttered incantation, she uncorked the vial and flung a handful of the dust into the air. The dust swirled for a moment, then defied gravity, arcing gracefully through the air before converging in a tight cloud near a dark stain on the dusty concrete floor. "Looks like blood," I said, squinting at the stain. "But not the usual kind."  The air around the stain felt cold, a chill that sent shivers down my spine. I didn't need to touch it to know it wasn't human. "You think it's the mage's blood?" Charlaine asked, her voice hushed.  I shook my head. "Maybe. But I'm not sure why he'd leave it here. Maybe he's trying to tell us something. Or maybe he's just messing with us."  The thought of that mage made my skin crawl. He was a chameleon, a master of illusion, and I couldn't shake the feeling that he was watching us, playing with us like a cat with a mouse. "Maybe he's making sure we know he's here," I said. "Leaving his mark.  A warning."  Charlaine was silent, her eyes fixed on the glowing cloud of dust. "Or a challenge," she whispered. The dust was settling now, the light fading, but I could feel the magic lingering in the air, a tangible presence that made the hairs on the back of my neck stand on end. The darkness in the basement seemed to deepen, as if the very walls were closing in on us, suffocating us with secrets.  It was time to leave.

"Looks like the mage's calling card," Charlaine said, her voice barely a whisper. "A claw...like the one on the murder twins." She held the rosette up to the light, examining it with a frown. It wasn't just the leather that felt...off. It was the way the stitching pulsed, ever so faintly.  A strange warmth emanated from the leather, tingling against my fingers.  "Well, we know what he likes," I said, the words tasting like ash in my mouth. "He likes claws."  The mage, who in the past week had gone from a ghost story to a living, breathing threat, was starting to feel like a ghost again. An unseen, unheard, but ever-present threat. We weren't getting anywhere, and I had a gut feeling we were wasting time in this dusty basement. There was nothing but the mage's calling card, a dead end.  We needed to get back to the station and strategize. The Bureau was supposed to arrive in the next couple of hours, and I didn't like it one bit.  "What do you make of it?" I asked Charlaine, my voice strained with impatience. She was still staring at the rosette, her eyes narrowed in thought. "The magic," she said slowly. "It's not...regular. Feels like…like…it's connected to something else. I can feel it."   She was right. The magic that pulsed from the leather felt...alien, like it didn't belong to this world.  We had a mage who was doing something he shouldn't, and now it seemed he was playing a game. I was starting to get the feeling we were just the pawns. I had no doubt the mage was watching us, laughing, and wondering what we would do next.

"Wait a minute," I said, my voice tinged with excitement. "This looks kinda familiar…" I reached into my pocket and pulled out a worn leather wallet. Inside, nestled amongst faded IDs and credit cards, was another rosette, identical to the one we’d just found. This one, however, still looked far newer, the leather supple and the stitching bright. It depicted the same stylized claw, but with a bold inscription circling it, “Fangs & Fur - 50th Anniversary.”

Charlaine snatched the wallet from my hand and flipped it over in her fingers. "I don't remember you being a fan of country music, Slate," she said, a mischievous glint in her eye. 

"Hey, who said I wasn't?" I chuckled, a little embarrassed. "I just never thought I'd be carrying a keepsake from some dusty old bar.” I shrugged and let out a sigh. “I figured you’d want the thing. After all, you're the one who does this voodoo magic stuff. I just keep it for good luck."

"So, a bar," she said, slowly nodding her head. "Could that be where the magic comes from?"

"Could be," I said, trying to sound nonchalant. "But why would the mage hang around a bar? Doesn't sound like his style, does it?"

"Maybe not," she said, her gaze flitting from the rosette to the dusty floor. "But then again, neither does the murder twins." She looked at me, her brow furrowed. “What are we going to do with this thing, Slate? We don’t have time to go chasing ghosts in honky-tonks.”

I looked at her, a sense of dread creeping up my spine. "I don't know, Charlie," I said, my voice flat. "But I got a feeling we're gonna find out, whether we want to or not."

"Fangs & Fur? The bar down by the docks?"  Charlaine's eyes widened in realization. 

I chuckled. "The one and only. I got this years ago when they celebrated their big five-oh. Guess someone from the bar must have ended up down here."

Charlaine tucked the unearthed rosette into her pocket, a new determination settling in her gaze. "Maybe," she said. "But the question is, why?" 

"I don't know, Charlie," I said, shaking my head. "But I got a feeling we're gonna find out, whether we want to or not."  I rubbed the bridge of my nose, feeling the strain of the long night. This was a weak lead, sure.  But it was the best we got. 

"Let's go and have a drink, shall we?"

Charlaine headed straight for Millie, the bartender. "Two beers," she said. "And a shot of whiskey, on the house." Millie raised an eyebrow, but said nothing, just nodded and got to work. I caught Krabat's eye, a silent challenge passing between us. He just smirked, a glint of something cold and calculating in his eyes. "Didn't think you'd be back here so soon, Slate," he said, his voice like a rasping whisper. "Thought you'd be busy chasing ghosts, or maybe trying to find those magical twins."  I ignored him, taking a seat at the bar. I felt Charlaine's eyes on me, curious about Krabat's presence. I raised my hand, silencing her. "We're not here for a chat, Krabat," I said. "We're here for information. About the rosette." Krabat’s smirk widened.  "The rosette, huh?  Funny thing, that. I happen to know a bit about those.  See, they were a fad a few years back.  You know, back in the good old days, when everyone liked to pretend they were rough and tough.  They were handed out to anyone who bought a drink or two.  Not particularly rare, those rosettes.  Think of them like a drink coaster."  "I don't believe in drink coasters, Krabat," I said. "And I'm not here for a history lesson. I need to know who was wearing that specific rosette in the basement.  Anyone.  Anyone who might have been in that basement with a similar one,  or anyone who bought a drink that night, the night the murders happened."  I leaned forward, my voice low and gravelly. "Tell me what you know."

Krabat watched us from the far end of the bar. He was leaning against a wall, sipping a drink that looked like a glass of water. He had a look about him, like a snake watching a mouse. I didn't trust the guy, but I needed him. I watched Charlaine, a flicker of something wild in her eyes. That girl, she was something special. I knew she was watching Krabat too. I could feel it.

"So, you're here to find the guy with the rosette." He said it like a riddle, not a statement. 

"We're here to find anyone who was in that basement with a rosette," I corrected him. "And anyone who bought a drink that night. The night the murders happened."

Krabat's eyes narrowed. He took a long sip of his drink, savoring the silence that followed. He was playing me. I knew he knew more than he was letting on.

"You want to know about the rosette," he said finally, his voice soft. "You want to know about the murders. You're going to have to tell me what you know first."

I took a slow sip of my tequila. "I know there's something going on here, Krabat. Something you're not telling me. Something big."

Krabat let out a dry laugh. "I always knew you were a sharp one, Slate. But you're a little late to the game, aren't you?" 

"We're never too late," Charlaine chimed in. She had her hand resting on the back of my chair.  "We'll figure it out."

Krabat's gaze flickered between us, a hint of something dark in his eyes. 

"Just tell me," I said. "Tell me what you know about the rosette." 

"The rosette?" He chuckled, his eyes glittering. "I can tell you that." He paused, letting the words hang in the air. "But it's gonna cost ya."

Charlaine took a cautious sip of her cappuccino, the frothy beverage a stark contrast to the rough-and-tumble atmosphere. Lowering her voice, she leaned towards Jam. "Alright, how do we approach this?" Jam shrugged, his expression stoic. "Casual. Ask around, see if anyone recognizes the rosette." Charlaine scanned the bar, her gaze settling on a group of burly men with tattoos. Taking a deep breath, she pushed off the bar stool. "Excuse me, gentlemen," Charlaine began, her voice polite yet firm. "Don't mean to bother you, but I was wondering if any of you might recognize this?" She pulled out the worn leather rosette, its sun-bleached brown catching the warm glow of the lanterns. The men squinted at it, their conversation momentarily stalling. "Can't say I have, miss," rumbled a man with a beard as thick as his arms. "Looks like some kinda old belt buckle." "Maybe a souvenir from a rodeo or somethin'," another man chimed in, a hint of amusement in his voice. Charlaine offered a smile that didn't quite reach her eyes. "Thanks anyway. Maybe someone else..." "Hey, sweetheart." Krabat strolled over, his boots clicking on the wooden floor. He was smiling, but it didn't reach his eyes. "Looking for something specific?" Charlaine didn't answer, she just stared at him, her eyes narrowed. "What is that?" He pointed at the rosette. Charlaine kept her eyes fixed on Krabat. I watched her, the muscles in her jaw tightening. She knew this guy was playing her. She knew he was hiding something. "It's nothing to you, Krabat." Jam cut in, his voice low and dangerous.  "But I bet you know exactly what it is." Krabat chuckled, a hollow sound that echoed through the bar. "You know me so well, Slate."  He took a sip of his drink. "Let's just say, I have a keen interest in rosettes."

"Millie!" I yelled over the din. The bartender, a woman with more wrinkles than a crumpled dollar bill, looked over. "You're still here?" She said with a tired smile. "Didn't you guys just leave?" 

"We're back," I replied. "We've been doing some digging, and we think we might have a lead."  I gestured to Charlaine, who held up the rosette. "Recognize this?"

Millie studied it for a moment. "Looks familiar," she said. "But I can't place it."

"It's a rosette, right? Like the ones you give out for anniversaries?" 

She nodded. "Yep, that's right." 

"Did you ever make one with a stylized claw on it?" 

She shook her head. "Nah, not that I recall. All our rosettes are pretty standard." 

Charlaine, her face as tight as a drumhead, stepped closer. "How often do you change these out?" 

"Every couple of years," Millie replied. "Whenever we run out." 

"So," Charlaine started, her voice clipped, "You have any idea where those old ones might be?"

Millie's smile faded. "Nope, they're gone. Old rosettes, along with the old bartenders who made them. You wanna talk to the old ones, you're gonna have to find their graves, honey."

She poured me another tequila, the glass practically singing as it clinked against the counter. The warmth traveled down my throat, burning away the chill of the basement. I felt the familiar sensation of being out of my element, but I'd learned to live with it. We were chasing ghosts in a town that had suddenly sprouted fangs and claws. 

"Tell you what, Millie," I said, the tequila loosening my tongue, "You ever see anybody hanging around here that kinda looks like they'd be interested in old, dusty relics?" 

Millie's eyes narrowed. "You're talking about that Krabat guy, aren't you?"

"Krabat?" Charlaine said, her voice laced with suspicion. "What about him?"

"He's been coming in more often lately," Millie said, her voice low. "Started asking me all sorts of questions. Things about old customers, old rosettes, old... everything. He's got a strange interest in things of the past."

"I guess he's not the only one," I said, tossing back the tequila.  "He might be our only lead. And if we're lucky, we might find him in a graveyard, with a shovel."

Krabat leaned in, his black eyes boring into Charlaine. "You're looking for something." It wasn't a question. "Well, I just happen to be a bit of a collector." He ran a hand through his white hair, a gesture that seemed to defy gravity itself.  "What exactly is this thing?" He tilted his head, an unsettlingly graceful movement, as he examined the rosette. "Something that belongs to the past." I watched Charlaine, her face a study in controlled irritation. She held the rosette out to him. "It's from here, right?" she said, her voice tight. "Fangs and Fur. You've been sniffing around, haven't you?" Krabat smiled, a slow, predatory grin. "I have a keen sense of smell," he said, his voice a silky whisper. "And a fondness for relics. Especially relics with a bit of a story behind them." I took a swig of tequila, the burn a welcome distraction from the growing tension. "So you're saying you found this thing in your attic?" I said, my voice thick with sarcasm.  "Or maybe," Krabat continued, ignoring my jab, "it was a gift. From a friend. Someone who knew you were looking for something. A friend who's quite fond of the past, and the secrets it holds." His eyes flicked to Charlaine, a hint of mischief lurking in their depths. "Don't you agree, Deputy?" Charlaine was a poker player, but even she couldn't hide the tremor in her jaw. "You're not just a collector, are you, Krabat?" she said, her voice low and dangerous. "You're a player." "Now, now," Krabat chuckled, his eyes sparkling with amusement. "Let's not jump to conclusions. I'm simply trying to be helpful. After all, we're all in this together, aren't we? We're trying to find out what happened to those two, aren't we?"

Krabat's words hung in the air, thick with meaning. But before Charlaine could press him for more, a new kind of trouble erupted. Bruno, a thickset human with a shaved head and a scowl, was winding up, fists clenched, ready to go.  Across the table from him, Grog, a hulking ogre with a beard like a tangled forest, was just as ready.  It was an ugly scene, this threat of violence hanging over the bar like a bad hangover.  

“You wouldn’t know an arm wrestle from a tea party,” Grog said, his voice like gravel grinding. 

“You sayin’ I’m a liar, green giant?” Bruno roared, his face turning a shade of red that matched his beer. "I’ll show you a liar!"

Millie, the bartender, threw up her hands in exasperation. “Not again!” she bellowed, but her voice was lost in the rising tension.  Grog stood up, his chair scraping against the floor. Bruno, not to be outdone, mirrored him.  Krabat’s lips twitched, a hint of amusement in his black eyes.  

“I wouldn’t want to miss this,” he murmured, his voice barely a whisper. Charlaine snorted. “You’re enjoying this, aren’t you?” she said, her eyes narrowed. Krabat shrugged. “Maybe. Or maybe I just like a good story,” he said, his eyes flicking to the scene unfolding in front of him.  “Now, where were we? Ah yes, relics. And the secrets they hold.”

Grog's eyes glinted, mischief bubbling over.  "Tequila, Sheriff? You sure about that? Millie only keeps the good stuff behind the counter, the kind that costs more than me or Bruno make in a week."  

Bruno, still fuming, scoffed.  "Yeah, right. Fancy sheriff liquor."

Grog chuckled, a deep rumble that shook the floorboards.  "Now hold on there, Bruno. I ain't sayin' no to a peace offering.  Especially not when the Sheriff's offering that kind of quality.  Appreciate the gesture, Sheriff.  One shot it is!"

Millie, who'd been bracing for a fight, offered Jam a grateful smile.  The two hulks, their anger simmering beneath the surface, lumbered towards the bar, their footsteps heavy and loud.  

"You know, these guys could use some of that 'good stuff' every day,"  Charlaine said, a wry smirk on her face.  

"Then Shadow Falls would be one hell of a town,"  I replied, glancing at Krabat, who was watching the unfolding scene with a flicker of something in his eyes that I couldn't quite place. 

"You know, I've always believed that a good drink can solve most problems," Krabat said, his voice smooth as velvet.  He stepped closer, his eyes gleaming.  "And if it doesn't, well, at least it makes the problems a little easier to bear." 

He pulled a slim silver flask from his pocket, the smooth metal catching the light.  "I always carry a little something to help me get through the rough patches," he said, holding it out to Charlaine. "Want a sip?"

I exchanged a wary glance with Charlaine.  There was something about that flask, something about Krabat, that felt off.  "Pass," Charlaine said, her eyes narrowing. 

"Suit yourself. Some people just aren't adventurous," Krabat said with a shrug, pocketing the flask.  He turned back to the bar, his eyes fixed on the two patrons as they tossed back their shots, the alcohol burning their throats.  

I watched the two of them,  the tension in the air palpable.  This fight hadn't been over, just postponed.  And Krabat, with his unsettling charm and his watchful gaze, felt like a part of this,  his presence as heavy as the dark clouds gathering on the horizon.

Krabat was gone. Charlaine too. I glanced at the bar, a dozen or so patrons staring at me, their eyes wide. Millie, her hand on the counter, looked like she'd seen a ghost. I checked my pockets, making sure my badge was still there. "Something funny, Millie?" I asked. The bartender shook her head, her smile gone. "No, Sheriff. Just, uh, wondering where they went." She gestured with a sweep of her hand, eyes fixed on the empty stools where Krabat and Charlaine had been sitting.  "Thought they just needed a breath of fresh air," I said, but my voice sounded hollow even to my own ears. Something was wrong. I smelled it. A faint whiff of ozone, tinged with the sharp scent of cloves.  It wasn't just a smell, it was a feeling. A prickling on the back of my neck, a sudden tightness in my chest. I knew that smell. Magic. Someone had moved them.  I took a slow breath, trying to calm my nerves. "Millie," I said, my voice a low growl. "You seen anyone come in or out here recently?"  "Not since those two left," she said, her voice tight. "They just, well, disappeared. Poof! Like magic." I nodded. Magic was a dirty word in Shadow Falls, a word that brought back memories of the old days, memories I didn't want to revisit. I scanned the faces around me, searching for anything, anyone, that might hold a clue.  There was the usual cast of characters, but none of them seemed to have seen anything.  Krabat.  The damn sorcerer.  I knew he was up to something, but I couldn't put my finger on it. All I knew was that Charlaine and Krabat were gone, whisked away by some unseen force, and I had a bad feeling about it.
