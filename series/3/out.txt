Charlaine, bless her heart, was still nervous about this whole magical thing. "You sure about this, Jam? We're just going to...walk into another ambush?" I glanced at the doorway, our only way in and out. There was no way the twins could pull a fast one like that again, not if they wanted to be in one piece. But you never know with magic. It can do crazy things, make things appear and disappear, warp reality itself. "We gotta see what happened. I got a hunch," I said, "and the Bureau's gonna be here soon. Ain't nobody needs those suits messing things up."

We took another slow pass through the basement, making sure to scan every corner. The place was filled with old machinery, rusting tools, and dusty debris, all of it just as I'd remembered it. I looked at Charlaine, and she pulled a flashlight from her bag, along with some other gadgets. "What's that?" I asked her. She just winked and said, "You'll see, Jam." She held the flashlight over a small pile of dust, illuminating a swirling blue mist. My gut tightened. It smelled like ozone. 

"Charlaine, you find anything?" She nodded and gestured with her flashlight. It was a small, shimmering vortex in the dust, almost invisible unless you knew what to look for. "I think that's where they went, Jam. That's what caused the ozone smell." I scanned the area again, the scent of rain in the air suddenly turned sour. This whole magical thing wasn't good. Not at all. I had a bad feeling about this, a sinking feeling that we were dealing with something way bigger than we thought. "What the hell is that, Charlaine?" I whispered. "Some kind of teleport portal. That's what happened to those twins. They didn't just disappear." The hairs on the back of my neck stood up. 

That's when I heard it. A voice, echoing from the darkness, a voice like a rustle in dead leaves. "Looking for something, Sheriff Slate?"

"See anything?", I rumbled, my voice low and steady. Charlaine shook her head, her brow furrowed in concentration. Unlike me, she wasn't relying solely on sight. Reaching into a worn pouch on her belt, she fished out a vial filled with shimmering dust; a pale lavender that seemed to glow faintly even in the dim light. With a muttered incantation, she uncorked the vial and flung a handful of the dust into the air. The dust swirled for a moment, then defied gravity, arcing gracefully through the air before converging in a tight cloud near a dark stain on the dusty concrete floor.

"What's that?" I asked, trying to keep my voice low, even though a chill had snaked down my spine. "It's a tracking dust, Jam," she said, her voice a hushed whisper. "My grandma gave it to me. It follows the magical traces of whatever it's dusted on." She pointed to the stain on the floor. It looked like blood, but there was something off about it, like it wasn't quite human. "The twins left a residue on the ground when they vanished. This dust will show us their path."

We both stared at the swirling dust cloud for a moment, then I pointed my flashlight towards the stain. It was deeper than it looked, a dark, almost viscous pool of something that shouldn't exist. I held my breath, the air in the basement thickening with anticipation. The dust began to rise, forming a swirling column that reached toward the ceiling, then dipped down again, tracing a path toward the opposite wall.  

"It's leading us to the wall," Charlaine said, her voice barely a breath. "But it doesn't look like a regular exit. It's more like...an opening." We cautiously approached the wall, the air growing heavy with the scent of ozone. The dust cloud swirled around the wall, revealing a faint blue glow. It seemed to ripple and shimmer, like water on a hot day. 

"It's like a portal," I muttered, my hand instinctively reaching for my gun, but it was useless against this kind of magic. This wasn't a regular case anymore.  This was something else, something I hadn't encountered before.  A shiver ran down my spine, and the stench of mildew in the basement seemed to intensify. "Let's see where it goes," I whispered, taking a step closer to the pulsing wall.

Charlaine picked up the rosette, her fingers tracing the worn leather. "This is some kind of magical trinket, Jam. It's not just regular leather. It feels..." She paused, her eyes widening. "It feels like a part of something else." She brought the rosette closer to my flashlight, its stitching catching the light. "It's a claw. A powerful one. But it's missing something." I squatted beside her, the scent of mildew and ozone clinging to the air. The pulsing wall hummed, almost like a living thing. "Missing something?" I asked, my voice a low rumble. "Yeah," she said, her eyes locked on the rosette. "There's another part to this. I can feel it." She held the rosette aloft, then turned to the wall, her eyes following the swirling dust. "It's calling to it. This thing... it wants to go back." She took a cautious step towards the wall, her eyes never leaving the rosette. "Come on, Jam. Let's see where this goes."

"Fangs & Fur," Charlaine repeated, her voice laced with surprise. She held both rosettes up, comparing them side-by-side. "Maybe this is some kind of… membership token?" 

Jam let out a low chuckle. "Membership token? In what? The Monster Mash? This place is older than dirt, Charlaine. Fifty years? That's nothing to this town. Besides, what kind of club would use a claw as a logo?"

"Maybe it's not just a club," she muttered, tracing the claw's outline with her fingertip. "It could be a… guild." 

"A guild?" I scoffed, "This ain't some fantasy novel, Charlaine." 

"I know, I know…" she murmured, "But think about it.  A secret organization... a hidden power... they're obviously connected to magic. It could explain why the twins vanished so suddenly." 

"Or maybe they're just a bunch of drunkards with a taste for the macabre," I countered, rolling my eyes. "I've seen more than my fair share of folks with a penchant for the bizarre in this town." 

"But what if they're more than just drunks?" Charlaine pressed, her eyes shining with a glint of excitement. "What if they're the ones who helped those twins disappear?" She gestured towards the swirling dust near the wall. "It feels like this magic is calling out to them. Like it wants to go back to where it came from." 

I stood up, stretching my stiff muscles. "Okay, okay. Fine. Let's go check out this 'Fangs & Fur' club, then. See what kind of secrets they're hiding." I tossed my worn fedora back onto my head, a feeling of grim determination settling in my gut. "Just one thing, Charlaine. I'm not going to be happy if it turns out all they do is sing karaoke."

"Fangs & Fur? The bar down by the docks?" Charlaine's eyes widened in realization.  I chuckled. "The one and only. I got this years ago when they celebrated their big five-oh. Guess someone from the bar must have ended up down here." Charlaine tucked the unearthed rosette into her pocket, a new determination settling in her gaze. "Maybe," she said. "But the question is, why?"  "Yeah, well," I said. "That's a good question. But it's the best lead we got, isn't it?" I gestured toward the cracked and chipped concrete walls of the basement. "Let's go and have a drink, shall we?"  Charlaine tilted her head, a thoughtful frown creasing her brow. "But what about the magic? Shouldn't we try to follow that?"  "We'll follow it," I assured her. "But first, we gotta find out what that rosette means.  And who better to ask than the folks who handed it out in the first place?"  "But you said it's just a bar," she said. "What if it's nothing? What if it's just a bunch of drunks and cowboys?"   "It's a bar in Shadow Falls," I said. "If that ain't a bunch of drunks and cowboys, I don't know what is." I grinned. "We're gonna have ourselves a little fun. But before we go, I need a drink, and you need a stiff drink, too. It's been a long day." Charlaine nodded,  a flicker of amusement in her eyes.  "You're right. I need a stiff drink, and maybe some of Millie's chili." She glanced up at me, a sudden apprehension in her eyes. "But what if that's where the twins went?"   "Then we'll follow them right into the heart of the bar," I said,  a flicker of steely resolve in my own eyes.  "No matter what they're hiding, we'll find it." I tossed my fedora back on my head and headed toward the stairs. "And if it's nothing, well, at least we'll have a good story to tell over our drinks."   Charlaine followed me, her eyes fixed on the rosette, her fingers tracing its weathered leather.   I knew she was right to be cautious. This could be nothing, just a red herring. But something about this rosette, about the way the magic dust clung to it, felt important.   I could feel it in my gut. This was no ordinary bar.

The rain pounded against the weathered exterior of Fangs and Fur as we stepped inside. Warm light spilled from the saloon, welcoming us into a world of flickering lanterns and twangy country music. Patrons, a mix of humans, shifters with subtle changes, and even a hulking troll nursing a mug of ale, crowded around worn wooden tables. In the corner, hunched over a steaming plate of ribs, was Krabat. He shot me a withering glance, the animosity between us simmering beneath the surface. Charlaine, however, received a subtle nod from the mage, a hint of friendliness in his usually stoic expression.

"Well, here we are," I said, my voice a bit too loud in the raucous atmosphere. "The home of the famous Fangs & Fur rosette." Charlaine, still clutching the weathered leather token, gave me a skeptical look. "You sure this is the right place?"  

I shrugged. "What, you think I'm gonna lead you astray? I'm the goddamn sheriff, remember? I don't have time for bar fights, especially not after what we've been through." I glanced over at the troll, who was eyeing Charlaine with a mixture of hunger and curiosity. "Besides, I need a drink."

The bartender, Millie, a woman whose weathered face held the warmth of a thousand sunsets, greeted us with a smile that crinkled at the corners. "Welcome to Fangs and Fur, honey. What'll it be?"

"Whiskey," I said. "And a double shot for my partner here." Millie nodded and started to pour. "So, what's the plan?" Charlaine asked. "We just waltz in here and ask them if they remember who bought a rosette?"

"Yeah, but with a little finesse," I said. "We gotta be clever. We gotta make them think we're just two tired cops looking for a shot of something stronger than the law." I winked at her. "Maybe we can even get them to spill the beans about who they're covering for."

Charlaine raised an eyebrow. "You think they're covering for someone? Someone involved in the murders?"

"It's a possibility," I said. "It's Shadow Falls. Ain't anything too far-fetched here. We'll see what we can dig up."  I took a long gulp of whiskey, the burn soothing the weariness in my bones.  "Now, let's get to work."

Millie, the weathered bartender, greeted us with a tired smile.  "The usual, Jam?" She placed a bottle of Tequila in front of me.  I nodded. Charlaine, staring at the bottle with a disapproving grimace, shook her head. "I'm on duty," she said, "Cappuccino, please." "This ain't no Starbucks, honey," Millie rumbled, but shuffled over to the espresso machine anyway. I took the shot glass Millie offered, the burn of the tequila a welcome relief against the chill of the rain seeping in from the open doors. I saw Krabat watching us from across the bar, his eyes narrowed in suspicion. "Got some questions for you," I said, pulling out the leather rosette. "This yours?" 
"The rosette? Sure do. That's one of the ones I gave out to the staff for the anniversary." He smiled, but his eyes didn't lose their intensity. 
"Well, we found this one down in the basement." I laid it on the bar. "It seems a little...well, worn. Like it was buried in the dirt for a while. Maybe someone with this rosette had a bad night, eh?" 
Krabat glanced at Charlaine, who was carefully examining the mug she'd just received. "What, are you accusing my staff of murder?" 
"Ain't accusing anyone, just asking questions. Like, who had this rosette? Any idea how it got down there?" I said. He took a sip of his beer. "Don't know, officer.  The place is busy. People come and go as they please. Maybe it was lost, maybe it was dropped." 
"And how about the broken bottle?" I asked. "The one with the rosette next to it? You think it fell out of the bottle?" 
He chuckled, shaking his head. "I'm not a magician, officer. I don't know how it got down there. Why don't you ask someone who does?" He pointed a thumb towards the door. "There's a good fortune teller on the next block. I hear she knows all about things lost and found." 
Charlaine looked at me, her gaze questioning.  I shrugged. "Not a bad idea," I said, pushing the glass towards Millie for another shot.  "We got nothin' to lose." 
I saw Krabat smile, a flicker of amusement in his eyes. It wasn't a friendly smile. It was the smile of a man who knew he'd just pulled the wool over our eyes. 
"Now, where was I?" I said. "Oh yeah, who had the rosette?" I looked at Krabat, my eyes boring into him.  "You're sure you don't know?" 
He sighed, his gaze falling on the rosette. "Like I said, officer, this place is busy. I couldn't tell you who wore that rosette. Maybe someone dropped it, maybe someone stole it." 
"And you never noticed anyone leaving in a hurry?" 
He shook his head. "No, but I'm sure someone else did. The bartender, the bouncer, maybe even Millie..."

"Casual," I echoed, "Like we're here for a drink and not a lead on a double murder. But, I ain't got time for a social call. Time for a little interrogation." Charlaine looked at me, eyebrows raised. She was good. Kept her head straight, but could tell when I was about to go rogue. "We'll go slow, Jam," she said. "Take it easy." "Easy," I scoffed, "Easy as a kick to the nuts." I grabbed a shot glass from the bar, filled it with tequila, and downed it in one gulp. "Time to make some friends. You got your magic dust?" "Always ready," she replied, her smile a bit too wide for my liking. She was getting the hang of this. 
"So," I said, "Anyone here recognize this rosette?" I waved it in front of their faces, the worn leather catching the dim light of the bar. The guys looked at the rosette, then at Charlaine, then at me. I saw a flicker of fear in their eyes, but they tried to hide it. "We don't know nothin' about no rosette, mister," one of them said, his voice thick with southern drawl. "We're just here for a good time." I laughed, a bitter, humorless sound. "Good time, eh?  Just like the murder twins, right? They were havin' a good time too.  Now, I ain't stupid, I see the fear in your eyes.  Either you're hiding something or you know something you shouldn't. Either way, you ain't gonna be leaving this bar until you talk to me." The bar went silent. The steel guitar stopped playing, and all eyes were on me. I liked the tension. It meant I was doing my job. I felt a cold shiver run down my spine, but it wasn't from the rain. It was something else.  A feeling of unease that settled in my gut, like a swarm of ants crawling beneath my skin. It was a feeling I knew all too well. It was a feeling of magic. And it was coming from the corner, where Krabat was sitting, his eyes watching me with a chilling intensity.  "Well, fellas," I said, my voice low and steady. "What's it gonna be? Tell me what you know, or tell me why you're scared?"

"Millie," I said, waving my hand towards the barkeep, "Come here a sec." Millie, always the picture of weariness, shuffled over, her eyes tired but sharp. "Jam, honey," she greeted, her voice a low rumble. "What can I do for you?" "See this?" I held out the rosette, its worn leather catching the lamplight. "Ever seen anything like it before?" Millie took the rosette, her gaze focused on the stylized claw. "Sure have, honey," she said, a hint of a smile playing on her lips. "That's one of the old Fangs & Fur rosettes. We used to hand 'em out to our regulars." "Regulars, huh?" I squinted at the rosette. "So, you think someone who frequents this bar might be involved in the killings?" Millie nodded. "Might be," she said. "But you gotta remember, honey, Fangs & Fur ain't just a bar. It's a haven. A place where everybody's got secrets." She winked, a mischievous glint in her eyes. "Ain't nothin' quite like Fangs & Fur for gettin' the truth out of folks, if you know what I mean." "Oh, I know what you mean," I replied, my voice dry. "What kind of regulars hang out here?" Millie ran a hand through her weathered hair. "All sorts," she said. "Werewolves, vampires, shifters, you name it. This ain't no ordinary bar, Jam. It's a meeting place for the... less ordinary." "Well, guess it's time to meet the less ordinary," I said, taking another swig of tequila. "Maybe they know somethin'. Or maybe they're just hiding somethin'. Either way, we gotta find out." Charlaine stepped closer. "Any regulars with tattoos?" Millie tilted her head, thinking. "Now, there's a few," she said, her voice low. "But most of 'em are on the quiet side.  You're lookin' for someone with a shady past, maybe somethin' to hide?  Try the guys in the back booth." "The back booth," I repeated, my voice sharp. "The one with the shadows?" Millie nodded. "That's the one. They're not the kind you want to mess with.  But you're a stubborn one, aren't ya, Jam?" I gave her a wry grin. "Stubborn as a mule, Millie." I turned to Charlaine. "Let's go have a little chat with those guys." I gave her a wink. "No magic dust this time. Just good old-fashioned charm." We approached the back booth. I could hear the murmur of voices, but I couldn't quite make out the words. As we got closer, I saw the glint of a blade hidden under the table, its silver surface reflecting the dim lamplight. I knew then that this was going to be a lot more than just a casual chat.

Krabat, with his usual, damned-if-you-do-damned-if-you-don't timing.  He was always where he needed to be, knew what was going on. The bastard could smell trouble from a mile away. “Just a little chat, Krabat. I'm sure you've got other more important things to do,” I said, trying to sound unconcerned. Krabat just smiled. A sharp, knowing smile that seemed to mock the way my insides were churning.  “No, I’m curious. Maybe this old trinket’s got a story to tell.”  He held out his hand, and I handed him the rosette. The way his fingers traced the stitching made me nervous. He knew too much.  He looked at it, turning it over in his hand.  “Interesting. An old family heirloom perhaps?  It’s certainly well-made.  A powerful magical signature on this,” he said, his voice barely above a whisper. "I don't know about you, but it gives me the creeps."

Krabat’s gaze shot to Charlaine, who stood there, frozen. “And yet, it's a fascinating clue, isn’t it, deputy?  There’s a lot of power in these things. A lot of secrets.  If you find out who made it, you might find your killer." He handed me back the rosette. "You might be surprised who wears them.” 

His words hung in the air like the smell of stale beer and sweat. "That's what we are trying to figure out.  We're just trying to do our jobs, Krabat.  You’re not interfering, are you?"

"I’d never interfere with the work of law enforcement,” he said, his eyes a dark pool of unknown depths. “And your job, sheriff, is to keep this town safe.  Even from the things you can’t see.” His gaze flickered towards the back booth where the tattooed men sat, their conversation now subdued.  "Maybe those men have answers."  He leaned in, his voice low. "Just a thought." With that, he turned and walked back towards the bar. I took a deep breath, the tequila burning a hole in my gut.  Krabat had a way of getting under your skin, a way of making you feel like you were being watched, judged. This town had a way of drawing in trouble, it seemed.  Maybe that was why I was still here, after all these years.  And maybe that was why I felt a growing sense of dread, a feeling that this was only the beginning of a dark, twisted story.  Krabat was right:  this rosette was a key.  We just had to find the right door to unlock.

The fight was brewing, thick as the stale beer and sweat in the air. The whole damn bar was buzzing with anticipation. Bruno, the human, was a walking, talking, beer-guzzling disaster, ready to pick a fight with his own shadow. Grog, the ogre, was twice his size and twice as pissed off, his green skin turning a shade of purple as Bruno’s braggadocio went on and on.  I watched the two of them, their fists clenched, their faces red with anger, like a couple of kids about to tangle in the schoolyard. I could practically hear the old-timers in the corner whispering about this being the start of another legendary brawl.

“No, I’m saying you’re a liar, green giant,” Bruno roared, his voice thick with bravado and booze.

“You wouldn’t know an arm wrestle from a tea party,” Grog countered, his voice a deep rumble that shook the rafters. 

Millie, bless her soul, was trying to diffuse the situation. She threw her hands up, exasperated, “Not again!”  She was more familiar with these bar fights than I was. She’d probably seen it all before. I know that from the way she just grabbed the nearest empty beer mug and tossed it into the nearest corner. 

It hit the wall with a loud clink and splattered into a hundred pieces. Millie, the damn heroine, had just declared war.  And you know what?  I didn’t mind. I was ready for a little action myself. 

A small part of me wanted to shout, “Enough’s enough, you two! This ain’t no goddamn rodeo,” but then again, I was in no mood to play peacemaker. The whole thing was getting on my nerves. I wanted to figure out the rosette, figure out who was involved, and find out just how deep this rabbit hole went. I had a bad feeling about this.  And I had a hunch that this fight was just another twist in a story that was only just starting.

Bruno was still simmering, but Grog was a man of his word. They both shuffled towards the bar, their faces still flushed, but the tension in the air had deflated a little. I figured I’d get them both liquored up enough to forget the whole thing. That was my strategy for everything, really.  Problem with people, they’re like cheap tequila; all brawn, no brains.  

“Millie,” I said, ignoring the glares Bruno was sending my way. “The good stuff. For my two friends here.”

Millie didn’t hesitate. She knew what I meant.  She grabbed two dusty shot glasses and filled them with a dark, smoky liquid that smelled like a campfire.  

“Don’t say I didn’t warn you,” she grumbled, her smile a little strained. “That’s the stuff that’ll knock the stuffing out of a man.”

The two brawlers didn’t seem to care. They took the glasses from Millie, their eyes gleaming with anticipation.  I watched as they both took a gulp, their faces contorting in a grimace as the tequila burned its way down their throats.   Grog coughed, a guttural sound that resonated through the room.  Bruno, meanwhile, just stared at his glass, speechless.

“That’s the good stuff,” Grog said, his voice a little strained.  “Thanks, Sheriff.” He raised his glass towards me. “To peace.”

Bruno mumbled something about a toast and downed his shot in one go. Then he hiccuped, his face turning a shade of red that could rival the sunset.  

Krabat, who had been watching the whole thing with a detached air, stepped forward. “That was… rather impressive, Sheriff.”

I ignored him and turned to Charlaine, who had been standing back, observing the whole scene. “This is why we need to get to the bottom of this,” I said, my voice low. "It’s like a damn powder keg.  Someone’s stirring things up."

“And I think we might just have a lead,” Charlaine said, her voice hushed. She held up the rosette, her eyes glinting with determination. “I managed to snag a word with Millie earlier. She remembers those rosettes.  Said they were a special promotion for a few years back, when they were celebrating their anniversary.  They gave them out to regulars.  The folks who were ‘true believers,’ she said.”

I nodded, taking a sip of my tequila. “The ‘true believers,’ eh? Now that’s interesting.”

“She mentioned a certain biker gang that was in town around that time.  A group called the ‘Iron Fang’,” Charlaine said. "She said they were a bunch of rough customers, always causing trouble, but Millie said they were ‘loyal.’  They only got their rosettes after they proved they were worth it."

I considered this for a moment, my mind racing. The Iron Fang.  They were a tough bunch.  Not the kind you’d want to tangle with, especially not if you were trying to keep your head attached.  But they were also pretty close-mouthed.  And they had a reputation for being fiercely loyal.  

“Iron Fang,” I repeated, the name rolling off my tongue like a curse. "Sounds like we're on the right track after all."

Krabat was gone. Charlaine was gone. 
They both left without a word, like they’d been swallowed whole. Just a minute ago they were both right here. Charlaine had been quizzing Millie about the rosettes, asking if she’d seen anything out of the ordinary. 
That’s when I smelled it. Ozone. That unmistakable, metallic tang. You could smell it in the air after a bad storm, right before the thunder cracked. But there wasn't any rain outside. I’d noticed that before, that strange scent wasn’t always tied to actual storms. In fact, in the past, I’d smelled it in the presence of magic, like a ghostly echo of a powerful spell.  And clove. I sniffed again, sure of it now. The scent of clove usually meant a mage was nearby. But, that’s what was so damned strange; there wasn’t a hint of clove in the air. No mage I’d ever encountered had left a scent like that, and a sudden rush of dread washed over me. 
I glanced at the barkeep, Millie. She looked as puzzled as I was. She seemed to be trying to figure out what was going on too. 
“Millie,” I said, “Have you seen anything? Heard anything?” 
She shook her head, her eyes narrowed. 
“Ain’t seen nothin’, Sheriff,” Millie said, her voice low. “They just kind of… disappeared.” 
“Disappeared? Like a puff of smoke?” I asked. She shook her head again. “More like a sudden chill,” she whispered, her gaze shifting towards the door. “Like something... went by.” 
I stared at the spot where Charlaine and Krabat had been a moment ago. They were gone. Vanished into thin air, just like the murder twins. The smell of ozone hung heavy, a reminder of the magic that had just unfolded. This was the same thing that had happened to the two twins. Magic. 
I felt a tremor run through me, not from the tequila, but from a sudden wave of fear. They were gone. Vanished. Just like that. And this time, I had no idea who to blame. 
But I knew one thing: I couldn't let them disappear without a trace. 
I grabbed my coat and headed for the door.
"Millie," I said. "Keep an eye out for anything, anything at all, that's out of the ordinary."
"You bet, Sheriff," Millie said, her voice firm. "I'll be watching."
As I stepped out into the night, I felt the chill in the air, the same one Millie had noticed. This wasn’t a chill from the storm; this was a chill that came from the heart of magic. A shiver ran down my spine. 
I took a deep breath, steeling myself for the fight ahead.
"I need to find them," I thought. "Whatever it takes."
The smell of ozone lingered in the air, a reminder of the magic that had just unfolded. I was on my own now. But I wouldn't stop until I found Charlaine and Krabat, even if it was the last thing I did. 
This town was a damn powder keg, and I wasn't about to let it explode.
