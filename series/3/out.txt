"Damn, it's a mess," I muttered. "Don't know how anyone could find anything in this place." Charlaine was crouched down, examining a pile of rubble. She was just a few feet away, but the distance felt like a mile in the dim light. "There's something here, Jam," she said. "Can you move this stuff, please?" I shifted the concrete slab with a grunt. It felt like moving a mountain, but it was child's play for a golem like me. She dug through the dust and debris, her face set in grim determination. "It's a symbol," she said, pulling out a piece of stained metal. "Kind of like a sigil." I took a closer look. It was an intricate pattern, like a spiderweb woven from thorns. "Can't make heads or tails of it," I admitted, but I felt a shiver down my spine.  "Looks familiar," I said, taking a deep breath of the stale air. "Where'd you see it?"  Charlaine looked up, a flicker of hope in her eyes.  "Fangs and Fur," she said. "On a belt buckle, a bartender was wearing it. She was a new face around town. I think her name was.. Lilith."

"Looks like a blood stain," I said, taking a closer look. "But not human."  The dust had settled on a dark stain, outlining the shape of a hand.  The air felt thick, like it was trying to suffocate me. I reached for my flask and took a long swig. I hadn't been sleeping well lately, and the heat made my clay feel like it was going to crack. "Don't tell me," I muttered. "It's another magical trace, isn't it?" "Yes, but I can't quite place it," she mumbled, studying the shimmering cloud of dust with a practiced eye. "Not like the one at the church. This one's..." She trailed off, her brow furrowed.  "Different," I finished, feeling a chill run down my spine. "Damn magic. What did it do to this place?"

"What is it?" I asked, feeling the back of my neck prickle. Charlaine didn't answer, just kept digging at the dirt. She pulled out the rosette. "It's not from around here," she said, holding it up to the light. "It's old, and… well, see for yourself." She looked up at me, her eyes wide. There was a kind of quiet fear in them that I hadn't seen in her before. But I knew that look. I’d seen it reflected in the eyes of many a suspect. I took the rosette from her. The leather felt rough under my fingers, the claw almost menacingly real. It reminded me of a place I hadn't been in a long time. A place where shadows clung to the corners and the air smelled of old leather and forgotten secrets.  I felt a pang of unease. It was a feeling I hadn't forgotten. And the smell, it was unmistakable, a faint, acrid scent that made my clay feel a bit… colder. "Charlaine," I said, my voice low and steady. "Where have you seen something like this before?"  She stared at the rosette for a long moment, her lips pressed tight together. "I remember," she whispered. "It's from the...the museum."  The museum.  The damn town museum. I'd walked past it a million times. Never really thought much about it. Just another dusty relic of a town that couldn't quite decide if it wanted to move forward or stand frozen in the past. "What about it?" I asked, my voice rough. "What's so special about a piece of leather?" Charlaine looked up at me, her gaze meeting mine. "It was part of a display," she said, her voice trembling slightly. "It was…it was supposed to be from a…a creature." A creature? I felt a chill run down my spine. What the hell kind of creature was in this town museum, and why were its relics showing up here in the basement?  I took a step back, my gaze sweeping across the room. "Well, I'm glad they got rid of it," I said. I wasn't sure if I was talking to myself or to her. "I always hated that place. Too many dusty memories."

"What?" Charlaine asked, her voice sharp with surprise. She eyed me like I was crazy. "You got a rosette in your wallet? From a bar?"
I shrugged. "Picked it up a while back. Thought it was cool. You know, souvenir." My grin widened. "Turns out, maybe this town’s got more history than we thought."
Charlaine stared at the rosette for a moment, then her eyes narrowed. "Maybe this place isn’t what we thought either," she said, her voice low. She pointed at the rosette in my hand. "This is new. And the one we found…" She pointed at the rosette in her hand, "This one’s old, like it’s been buried for years." 
I stared at the rosettes. One new, one old, both bearing the same claw and inscription. "So, what’re we looking at here, Charlaine?" I asked, my voice rough. "Is this some kind of… clue?" 
"I don’t know," she said, her voice tight with unease. "But I think we gotta go to Fangs and Fur." 
"Fangs and Fur?" I scoffed. "What, are you gonna find the killer there? In a bar? That’s a terrible idea." I ran a hand over my face. The heat in the basement was making my clay feel tight.  
"It’s the only place I can think of," she said, her eyes meeting mine. "We need to ask Millie." 
"Ask Millie what? What’s this, some kinda supernatural game of hide and seek?" I sighed. "It’s getting late.  I’m tired. But fine, let’s go to the bar." I stood up. "And while we’re at it, let's hope it doesn’t involve anything… sticky."

Charlaine's eyes widened in realization. "Fangs & Fur? The bar down by the docks?" I chuckled. "The one and only. I got this years ago when they celebrated their big five-oh. Guess someone from the bar must have ended up down here." Charlaine tucked the unearthed rosette into her pocket, a new determination settling in her gaze. "Maybe," she said. "But the question is, why?" I sighed. "Weak lead, but it's the best thing we got. Let's go and have a drink, shall we?"

I nodded to Millie, the bartender, a woman whose weathered face held the warmth of a thousand sunsets.  She smiled, crinkled at the corners. "Usual?" I grunted. She poured two glasses of whiskey, no ice. I knew what Charlaine preferred, even if she never said. Charlaine took a seat across from me, and I slid her glass her way. "So," she said, her eyes fixed on the leather rosette, "You think that's our guy?" I took a swig of whiskey, the burn momentarily forgetting the gnawing ache in my gut. "Maybe. Or maybe it's just a coincidence. But this place is a magnet for every kinda oddball in Shadow Falls.  And whoever those guys were, they weren't playing nice." Charlaine's eyebrows shot up, and she swirled the whiskey in her glass. "You think they're dead?"

"Two shots, huh?" Charlaine said, her eyes darting around the room. "That's a lot of tequila for a Tuesday." 

I shrugged, taking a long pull from the bottle. "Just trying to stay warm. This place is colder than a witch's..." I stopped, my words suddenly dying in my throat. My eyes fell on a man at the end of the bar, his back to us. Tall, broad-shouldered, with a dark, hooded cloak pulled low over his face. His presence radiated an unsettling chill, like a storm cloud settling over the bar. I couldn't place him, but something about him was familiar, like a half-forgotten dream. The scent of ozone hung in the air, sharp and pungent, making my clay skin prickle. I caught Charlaine staring at the man, her brow furrowed in concentration. She was sensing something too, something beyond the ordinary.

Charlaine's smile was a good try. Those men knew something. It was in their eyes, a flicker of something… guarded. I sighed, the tequila burning a warm trail down my throat.  "We'll try again later, Charlaine." She nodded, disappointment etched on her face. "But I'm not giving up, Jam." I patted her arm. "Good girl." 
 "Say, hey," I said, gesturing toward the cloaked figure. "You think that's the one we're looking for?" Charlaine followed my gaze. "Maybe. I don't think he's human. I'm sensing a powerful magical signature." "Powerful… huh?" I chuckled, my gut tightening. 
 "That just makes things all the more interesting, doesn't it?"

"Millie," I said, gesturing to the bartender. "You know this thing, right?" She took the rosette, her eyes scanning the worn leather. "Ah, that old thing. It's just a bar trinket. We used to give 'em out to folks who had been around long enough. I guess we got a bunch of 'em in the back." "Used to?" Charlaine asked. Millie shrugged, her eyes glinting with something more than fatigue. "Used to have a lot of folks, kid. Not so much anymore."  I gave Charlaine a sideways glance. Millie's words were cryptic, but her tone was laced with a hint of unspoken truth. "Know anything about who might have had this one?" "A fella with a silver tongue and eyes like fire." Millie's gaze drifted to the corner where Krabat sat, his back straight, a predatory glint in his eyes. "Been a while since I've seen him, though."

"Mind if I join you?" Krabat's voice cut through the air, as smooth as a well-worn whiskey. "Heard you two were having a little chat."  I eyed him, my gut churning. The way he said "chat" - it wasn't just a friendly inquiry. It was a veiled threat. "Don't mind if I do," I said, my voice rough. "But you might want to hold off on those magic tricks for a while. We're a little busy right now." Krabat chuckled, a low, rumbling sound. "Oh, I wouldn't dream of it, Sheriff. Just thought I might offer a little insight." He reached out, his long fingers gently taking the rosette from Charlaine.  His eyes, black as midnight, scanned the faded leather, the stitching, the inscription. "Interesting," he murmured. "A little old, isn't it? Looks like something from the early days of Shadow Falls.  A relic of a time before the magic disappeared." Charlaine frowned. "The magic never disappeared, Krabat. Just got a little less... public." He let out a soft laugh, a sound that sent chills down my spine. "You two have a lot to learn about this town, deputy. And its secrets."  I could feel Charlaine's eyes on me, her worry palpable.  "So you know something about this rosette," I said, my voice tight. "Maybe you can tell us about the fella with the silver tongue and eyes like fire?" Krabat raised an eyebrow, his smile slow and predatory. "Ah, Sheriff, you are getting ahead of yourself. Let's just say I know a thing or two about this town. And its darker corners."  He held out the rosette, his gaze piercing. "It's a small town, Sheriff. Everyone knows everyone. And everyone has secrets."  He slipped the rosette back into Charlaine's hand and turned to leave. "Just be careful, both of you. You might find yourself in over your heads." He paused at the door, his eyes lingering on Charlaine.  "Or you might find something more," he said, his voice a low whisper.  Then, with a final, enigmatic glance, he vanished into the night.

Krabat's words were still echoing in my head, each syllable a jagged shard of ice. "Secrets," he said, "Everyone has secrets." Yeah, that's the truth, but it wasn't the secrets I was interested in right now. What I was interested in was Bruno, the human, about to lose his teeth. I was too busy watching him, this greasy human with a chip on his shoulder and an itch for a brawl, to notice Charlaine slipping away. 

The air crackled with tension. My clay skin, usually impervious to such things, tingled with the electric atmosphere. "Bruno," I growled, my voice a low rumble, "You want to start a fight, you'll find yourself staring at a whole lotta concrete. No one wants to see that." Bruno, still puffed up with alcohol and testosterone, didn't hear me. 

"I'm tellin' ya," he said, "The guy was a mountain of a man. Had arms like tree trunks. He went down like a sack of potatoes when I took his hand." Grog, with his thick green skin and a beard that could house a family of squirrels, laughed a guttural laugh. 

"You liar," he said, "You're so full of it, I could stuff you into a burlap sack."  "Don't make me laugh, big guy," Bruno said, pushing back his chair. "I've seen you around. You're all brawn and no brain." 

Grog's eyes, filled with a simmering rage, locked onto Bruno's. "I've had enough of your lying," Grog growled, his voice like thunder rolling through the bar. He stood up, his massive frame dwarfing Bruno.  "I'm gonna make you eat your words, you little punk." Bruno rose, shoving his chair back so hard it crashed against the wall.  I was ready to step in, but then something caught my eye.  I noticed a flash of lavender, disappearing into the back of the bar. "Charlaine," I said, "Where are you going?"  The fight had momentarily stalled.  I watched as Charlaine ducked out of sight, and that's when it hit me.  She wasn't going to let Krabat's cryptic message go unanswered. She was on her way to find her own answers, whatever they may be.

Bruno, still fuming, scoffed. "Yeah, right. Fancy sheriff liquor." Grog chuckled, a deep rumble that shook the floorboards. "Now hold on there, Bruno. I ain't sayin' no to a peace offering. Especially not when the Sheriff's offering that kind of quality. Appreciate the gesture, Sheriff. One shot it is!" Millie, who'd been bracing for a fight, offered Jam a grateful smile. "Don't mention it, Millie. You'll make a fortune in tips tonight." I winked at Millie.  I didn't want to start a fight, but I didn't want to wait until one happened, either. These two guys were ticking time bombs. One wrong word, and the whole bar could go up in flames. Besides, I was curious to see what Krabat was up to.  "Now, how about we have a round on the house for everyone, eh?" I said, my eyes flitting towards the back of the bar. No sign of Charlaine. "Don't get your hopes up, Sheriff," Grog said, his voice a low growl. "My kind don't need freebies."  Bruno, as if finally realizing the situation, chimed in, "Yeah, you're gonna have to find a way to make up for the damage that little punk did to my shirt." I raised my eyebrows. "You sayin' you're gonna make trouble?" I asked, my tone flat and emotionless. Bruno swallowed, his arrogance momentarily replaced with a flicker of fear. "No sir, just stating a fact." "Good," I growled.  "Now go ahead and get a drink. And for the love of everything holy, try to keep your mouths shut for five minutes, yeah?"  They both mumbled agreement, and I headed towards Millie, a bottle of tequila clutched in my hand. The fight was over, for now. But the tension in the air hung thick and heavy, a storm waiting to break. I took a swig, the fiery liquid burning a path down my throat. "This place is getting more dangerous by the minute, Millie," I muttered, my gaze fixed on the back of the bar. "Charlaine's been gone for a while." Millie gave me a knowing look. "She's smart, that one. Knows how to find what she wants."  I took another gulp of tequila, the warmth spreading through me, a temporary comfort in the swirling chaos of Shadow Falls.  I had a feeling this was only the beginning.

I turned back to Millie, "Hey, Millie. Seen Charlaine and Krabat? They just disappeared." Millie shook her head. "Nope, haven't seen them. They were here just a minute ago. Talking about..." She paused, then muttered, "Something about a rosette." "A rosette?" I frowned, my gaze scanning the bar. "You sure?" Millie shrugged, wiping down a glass with a practiced flick of the wrist. "Maybe I just imagined it.  Lots of strange things happen here, you know." I took another swig of tequila, the warmth a fleeting comfort.  Something was wrong, and I didn't like the feeling in my gut.  I sniffed the air, a faint scent of ozone hitting my nostrils.  Then, a hint of clove.  My blood turned to ice.  Someone had magicked them away.
