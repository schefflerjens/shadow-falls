At least, we're out of the woods now," I said, turning the corner onto Maple Lane. "It could have been worse."

Charlaine nodded, but her face was still pale. She stared at the empty road, her eyes filled with a distant look. "How did you know?" she asked, her voice barely a whisper. "How did you know I was in that forest?"

I shrugged. "I'm the sheriff, remember? I have ways."

She knew I wasn't telling the whole truth. I didn't tell her about the doll. She didn't need to know about the magic. It only complicated things.  But her grandma would.  I hoped.

The streetlamps flickered as we drove past. The town was quiet, the air thick with the scent of pine and something else, something metallic and sharp.  It made me think of blood. I was starting to get that feeling again. Like something was wrong. Like something was about to go down.

"Jam, what was that... thing?" Charlaine asked. "The doll?"

"Just a little something I picked up from the pawn shop," I said, hoping she wouldn't push it any further.  "A real antique.  Maybe something that was passed down for generations."

That was as close as I was going to get to the truth.  Charlaine was a good girl, but I was pretty sure she wouldn't believe me if I told her that my little 'toy' was a magic doll.  

Her grandmother might, though.  The old woman was a manbo, a Voodoo priestess.  She had a thing for these kinds of things.  A knack for the occult.  A taste for the strange.

As we pulled up to her house, I noticed that the porch light was off.  That was odd.  Usually, the porch light was on, a beacon in the dark.  The old lady was always up late, working her magic.

I stopped the car, cut the engine.  The silence of the town seemed to swallow us whole.  I wasn't sure if the silence was unsettling because it was too quiet or if I was just on edge after that little jaunt in the woods. 

"Maybe she's not home," Charlaine said, her voice tight.

"She's always home," I said.  I opened the car door and got out. The air was cold, a sharp bite that made me wish I had brought my jacket. I looked at Charlaine, who remained in the car, her hands clenched in her lap.  "Stay here."

"Jam," she whispered, "are you sure you don't want me to come with you?"

I ignored her and headed for the front door. I reached for the knob, my hand feeling cold and clammy.  I turned the knob, and the door swung open with a creak.  The house was dark, the air thick with the smell of incense and something else, something cloying and sweet.  Like the smell of blood.

I took a step inside, my senses on high alert.  I could hear the soft chirping of crickets, the rustling of leaves outside, the faint ticking of a clock somewhere in the house.  But I couldn't hear any other sounds.  No voices. No footsteps.  Just the quiet.

I felt a chill run down my spine.  Something was wrong.  This felt different.  I wasn't sure what it was, but I knew it was bad.

"Charlaine, come on in," I said, my voice tight.  "Let's get out of here.  Maybe we can find a payphone and call the mayor."  I knew, though, that there wasn't a payphone in Shadow Falls.  They hadn't existed for decades. The mayor would probably be at home, asleep.  And I had a bad feeling that he wasn't going to answer.

It wasn't like I could just waltz into his bedroom and wake him up. Not unless I wanted a confrontation. And I wasn't looking to tangle with a vampire when the air felt this heavy.

"Jam, what's wrong?" Charlaine's voice was barely a whisper. It was good to know that some things didn't change, even when the world felt like it was falling apart.  

I took another step into the house, my hand trailing along the wall. My feet made a soft thud on the wooden floorboards, but the silence was still too thick. Too oppressive. I could feel my clay body stiffening, a tight band around my chest.  The heat was coming back, the heat of the sun that never quite left my skin. 

"It's not good, Charlaine. It's bad. It's bad news." I tried to keep my voice calm, but it came out shaky. It was hard to keep things together when the ground beneath you felt like it was shifting. "I thought I could get some answers from your grandma. Maybe she could help me understand what's going on." 

"But... she's..." Charlaine's voice trailed off. She knew what I was talking about, she knew about the deal. I knew she knew. 

Papa Legba, the trickster god, had helped me out when I needed it most. When the Murder Twins had come for the old woman, I was a few towns over, dealing with a rogue werewolf who thought it would be funny to steal Mrs. Peabody's prize-winning pumpkin. I wasn't there when the twins struck, but I was there when the little doll made a sudden appearance in my car, right after the twins disappeared. And it was a little doll that saved the old woman.  Just like it was Legba who'd made sure she lived through the night.  It was a price, though, the price of a debt owed. But maybe I owed her this too. I might owe her more than I knew.  

"Charlaine, this is about more than just your grandma. This is about Shadow Falls. About everything we've built here.  And I have a bad feeling that we're about to lose it all."

And I have a bad feeling that we're about to lose it all."

Charlaine stared at me, her eyes wide. She looked like a doe caught in headlights, but even those eyes had a glint of defiance in them. 

“What’s going on, Jam?”

"The doll, Charlaine. It's not just a doll. It's a message. A warning.  It's about your grandma."

She shook her head, her dark curls bouncing. "No way, Jam. My grandma wouldn't... she's not like that."

"I know your grandma, Charlaine. She's a good woman. But she’s also one of the few people who’ve managed to hold a conversation with Papa Legba. And that kind of connection comes with... strings attached." 

“But I don't understand. Why would she..." 

Her words were lost in the thick silence that filled the house. I felt the weight of it all, the fear and confusion, pressing down on me. My clay body stiffened, aching with the heat that always came with a heavy dose of the unknown. 

“This isn’t just about your grandma, Charlaine. It’s about Shadow Falls. The twins. Krabat. Anna… everyone.”

Charlaine swallowed hard, her eyes fixed on the doll resting on the floor. It was just a simple rag doll, stitched together with faded blue fabric, but it held a power that sent chills down my spine. It was a beacon in the fog, a warning sign pointing to a storm I couldn't see coming.

"We need to talk to your grandma, Charlaine. We need to know what she knows. What she's done. What's about to happen."

Her expression hardened, her chin lifted defiantly. "We're going to see her, Jam. But I ain’t gonna let you talk to her like she’s some kind of suspect."

I took a deep breath, trying to steady myself. "You’re right, Charlaine. I wouldn’t want to accuse her of anything. We just need to find out what’s going on."

"We need to be careful, Jam. We’re walking into a spider’s web. And this time, I don’t think we’ll be able to walk away clean.”

We found her in the town pharmacy, where she'd been a fixture for as long as I could remember. The place reeked of lavender and old medicine. It was the only place in town where the scent of peppermint was stronger than the smell of maple syrup. Charlaine's grandma had a nose for herbs and a way with a mortar and pestle that would make you think she was brewing up some kind of magical elixir. 

We rattled on the door like a couple of restless ghosts. We were already in deep enough, no use being quiet about it. Then, a dim light flickered on in the back, and the door creaked open. "Jam? Charlaine? What are you doing here, at this hour?" 

Her voice was raspy, like she’d just woken up from a dream, or maybe from a long sleep. The light inside the shop was weak, but I could see the tired lines etched around her eyes. They were the kind of lines that tell a story, the kind that have been carved by years of laughter and tears, by nights spent under a moonlit sky and mornings spent under the watchful gaze of the sunrise. 

“We need to talk, Mamie,” I said, my voice as steady as I could manage. 

“Couldn’t this wait for morning? You know I’m not a morning person.” 

“Not this time, Mamie.”

Charlaine stepped past me, into the shop. The air inside felt thick, like it was holding its breath. The shelves were lined with jars and bottles, each one filled with something that promised a cure, or maybe just a little bit of magic. 

"I know about the doll," Charlaine said, her voice low and tight. "I know what it means. I know what you've done." 

The old woman smiled, but it wasn’t a friendly smile. It was a smile that had seen too much, that had held too many secrets. It was a smile that knew things, and it wasn't willing to share them. 

"Well, now, Charlaine. I wouldn't go accusing your grandma of anything," I said. 

I took a step forward, but Charlaine grabbed my arm, her grip firm. “We’re not here to accuse, Jam. We’re here to help. We’re here to understand." 

The old woman leaned against the counter, her back straight, her head held high. "Help?  You think you can help me, child? You think you can help Shadow Falls?" 

“We can try,” Charlaine said. 

Her voice was steady, but the fear in her eyes was a silent plea. She knew, I knew, that this wasn't just a simple visit to the pharmacy. We were walking into the heart of a storm.  

“We don’t have much time, Mamie,” I said. “It’s going to be a long night.”

Mamie’s gaze lingered on Charlaine, her eyes as deep as the old mahogany countertop she rested her hand upon. Her smile faltered, replaced by a weariness that settled like a fog in the room. The air hummed with a barely perceptible energy, a low thrum that danced around her like a swarm of unseen insects. A silver amulet, intricately carved with swirling patterns, hung from her neck, catching the dim light in a mesmerizing dance. 

“Long night?”  Mamie’s voice was a sigh, a whisper of the wind that rustled through the leaves of the ancient maple tree outside.  “What kind of long night?  It’s been a long night for a while now, Jam.” 

“The kind that brings out the shadows, Mamie,” Charlaine said. She met her grandmother’s gaze, her own eyes holding a mixture of fear and determination. “And the shadows have started to play.” 

Mamie's gaze drifted towards the back of the shop, her eyes seeming to pierce the darkness.  The smell of old herbs, pungent and earthy, intensified as if the air itself was holding its breath. "Play? Is that what they call it? They’re not playing, Charlaine. They’re dancing. And they’re coming for us all.”  

The old woman moved with a surprising agility for someone her age, retrieving a tarnished silver goblet from the back room. The metal glowed softly in the weak light, its surface adorned with faded engravings that seemed to writhe and shift.  She held it out to Charlaine. “You might need this tonight, child.”  

Charlaine took the goblet, her fingers brushing against the cool metal. She felt a surge of energy, a tingling sensation that spread through her like a jolt of electricity. “What is it?” she asked, her voice barely above a whisper. 

“A reminder of what you’re up against,” Mamie said, her eyes holding a glint of something fierce, something ancient. “And a reminder of what you’re fighting for.” She turned back to me, her gaze unwavering.  “Tell me, Jam, what brings you here, to the heart of my shop, at this hour?  Are you here to tell me you’ve seen the shadow too?  Or did you come for a bottle of cough syrup?  ‘Cause I can’t tell you, Jam, that ain’t a cure for everything.”

“Tell me, Jam, what brings you here, to the heart of my shop, at this hour? Are you here to tell me you’ve seen the shadow too? Or did you come for a bottle of cough syrup? ‘Cause I can’t tell you, Jam, that ain’t a cure for everything.”

“It ain’t the cough syrup, Mamie. It’s worse than that.” I took a slow drag on my cigarette. “Folks been disappearing. Three in the last week. One by one. Like a game of hide and seek, but nobody’s laughing.” 

“Don’t start with the riddles, Jam. It’s been a long night.” Charlaine tapped her silver goblet against the counter.

“Not riddles. Just facts. The first one, he went missing from the church. Found his wallet, a few books, but that was it.” I tapped my fingers on the counter.

“The church? That’s where they take the lost things, Jam. Maybe he just found God. Maybe he’s happy now.”

Mamie had a point. Shadow Falls was a peculiar town. It was hard to tell who was truly lost and who chose to disappear. “This ain’t no lost souls, Mamie. They’re missing. No notes, no screams. Not even a trace of a struggle. And not the usual town drunk type. This time it’s the kind of folks that pay their taxes, vote in every election. Folks that make trouble only when the squirrels steal their tomatoes.”

“What about the forest? That’s where they go.” Charlaine’s eyes held a glint of steel, a fire that mirrored the silver amulet around her neck. “Something’s wrong in those woods, Jam.”

“The woods are fine, Charlaine. It’s the thing in the woods that ain’t fine.  And the thing in the woods is probably just bored.”

“The woods are whispering,” Mamie said, her voice a low rumble. “They’re talking about shadows. Shadows that eat the light.”

“It’s Krabat. That’s what it is. That slimebag is up to something, I can feel it. He’s been prowling those woods. Maybe he’s got a new line of creepy antiques to sell.” I grunted. 

“Krabat?” Charlaine scoffed. “You always blame everything on him. You know, you’re starting to sound like Anna.  What about those…murder twins? You’ve been on edge about them ever since you found those dolls.” 

“Anna’s right about some things. But those dolls…they’re not dolls. At least, they weren’t. I was called out to a woman’s house. She was convinced her daughter had stolen a doll from the antique shop. Turns out the doll was her daughter. All grown up, but shrunk down to the size of a porcelain doll.  She was dead. Krabat, of course, claimed he sold the doll. Said it was a perfectly normal, if slightly eerie, doll. But the doll had teeth, and a nasty stare, and the smell of clove and ozone.  I took the doll to the station, but by morning, it was gone.”

“So Krabat got rid of the evidence? You’re sure he’s up to something, right?” Charlaine said, a mischievous glint in her eye.

“Charlaine,” Mamie said, her voice calm and steady. “You’re gonna have to be careful. You’re not dealing with squirrels stealing tomatoes.” 

Mamie turned and shuffled toward the back of the shop, her steps slow but purposeful. The air grew thicker with the scent of herbs and something else… something ancient and primal. 

“Careful, huh? I don’t know, Mamie. I’ve been careful for centuries. And look at the state of things.” I shrugged, puffing out a plume of smoke. “Maybe it’s time to just let things go.”

“You can’t, Jam. You know that. We need you.” Charlaine’s voice was low, but it held a strength that surprised me.

“And who are we, Charlaine? Is that your new mantra?  You got a whole new team of superheroes ready to fight the good fight? Or is this just another one of your grand plans for Shadow Falls?” I leaned back against the counter, the wood cool against my back. “And what exactly is it that we’re fighting for? What’s so good about the good fight?” 

I looked at Charlaine, her eyes shining in the dimly lit room. Then I looked back at Mamie, who was now returning with a steaming cup of tea.  She set it on the counter, a gentle smile gracing her lips. “We’re fighting for what’s left, Jam. For what’s still good in this world. And we’re fighting for each other.”

“So you’re saying I’m good?” I chuckled.  “That’s a first.”

Mamie’s smile widened. “Oh, you’re good, Jam. You always have been.” She patted my hand, her touch surprisingly strong. “Now, drink your tea. You look like you could use it.” 

I took the tea, the steam warming my face. The tea was sweet and spicy, a familiar comfort in this world of shadows and whispers.  But the comfort was fleeting.  

“How about we start with finding those folks, Mamie? Maybe we can find a way to put things right.”  

“Oh, Jam. Things ain’t ever really right. But we can make ‘em better. Or at least make sure the shadow doesn’t get too much of the light. Just make sure you’re careful. This one…this one’s different.” 

Mamie’s gaze lingered on Charlaine, her eyes dark and knowing. I knew she was right. This one was different.  And it was up to me, the old golem, and my young, fiery deputy to put things right, before the shadow swallowed Shadow Falls whole.

“You’re right, Mamie. I can feel it,” Charlaine said.  Her voice was tight, a hint of fear in it. She was a tough kid, but even she could sense the shift in the air, the cold bite of magic.

Mamie nodded, her eyes taking in Charlaine’s face.  “It’s the Crossroads magic, child. Powerful stuff. It’s an old enchantment, a link to the crossroads between the worlds.  Only one strong enough to wield it can break the curse.”

“Curse?” Charlaine looked at me, her eyes wide. I shrugged. I didn’t know anything about curses, or magic for that matter. My magic, if you could call it that, was more of a simple matter of survival, keeping my clay moist.

Mamie placed a hand on Charlaine’s shoulder, her touch firm.  “Your grandmother, her lineage, it’s strong.  The magic that lies dormant in you…it’s been awakened.”  

I looked at Charlaine, her face pale and her eyes wide. I had never thought of her as anything other than a tough, smart kid.  And now this?  

“What does this mean? For me, for Shadow Falls? For the doll?” Charlaine asked, her voice small.

“It means you’re tied to the doll, Charlaine. The doll is a part of you.  And the magic…it’s a part of you too.” Mamie looked at me, a glint in her eye.  “And it’s a part of the old golem too. You both have been touched by it. You both have a role to play.”

"It can't just be a doll," I said. "That's crazy."  

“It’s not just a doll, Jam,” Mamie said, her voice low and steady. “She was a child, stolen from this world. Her spirit, her essence, bound to the doll.  A crossroads spell, a powerful one.”

“What do we do?” Charlaine asked.  Her face was a mask of fear and determination. 

“We find the Murder Twins,” Mamie said, her voice unwavering.  “We get that doll back. And we figure out who the hell’s got a hold of it.”  

I knew Mamie was right. There was a powerful force at work in Shadow Falls. And it had me, Charlaine, and maybe even the whole town in its sights. I looked at Charlaine. She had her grandmother’s courage, her spirit,  a spark of that magic in her eyes.  Maybe we could fight this thing, maybe we could bring the light back.  Maybe.

 “Alright, Mamie,” I said, puffing out a cloud of smoke.  “We’ll find the twins.  But I’m not going to like it.”  

Mamie chuckled, her eyes gleaming in the dim light.  “Oh, Jam.  You never do.”

"You never do." Mamie chuckled, her eyes gleaming in the dim light. I knew she meant it. I never liked the supernatural, not since my first encounter with a werewolf back in the 1890s. But this was different. This was about a child, and a curse. And a damn doll. 

"So," I said, trying to sound casual, "who's got a hand in this? The doll, the crossroads magic, the whole shebang. You said this was a powerful spell, Mamie." 

Mamie's smile faded. Her eyes, normally a bright brown, turned a shade darker. "It's not just any crossroads magic, Jam. It's... well, it's Papa Legba's work."

I blinked. "Papa Legba? That old coot? What's he got to do with this?" 

Mamie didn't answer right away. She looked at Charlaine, then back at me. "He's got a vested interest in Charlaine. He's always been watching her, waiting for her to come into her own."

I stared at Charlaine, who was staring back at me with a look of pure confusion. "Did you know about this?" I asked her.

"Not really," Charlaine said. "I just...I felt different lately. Stronger, more alive. And I've had these...visions. Like flashes of the past, of the future, of something I don't even understand."

"And you're sure it's Papa Legba?" I asked Mamie.

"I'm not sure about anything," Mamie admitted. "But there's a feeling. A presence, like a shadow. And it smells like cloves and ozone."

My gut twisted. That was the Murder Twins' scent. And Papa Legba had a fondness for them. Maybe it was all a coincidence, but my clay didn't like the sound of it. 

I looked at Charlaine. "So, you're saying this old Voodoo god is trying to pull the strings? Why?" 

Mamie shrugged. "Who knows? Maybe he's got a taste for dolls. Or maybe he's trying to test Charlaine. Or maybe he's got something else in mind." 

"Maybe you could ask him?" I said. "You know him, right?"

Mamie chuckled. "Jam, I don't know Papa Legba. I'm just a humble woman who knows how to read tea leaves."

"You're telling me that you know a god, but can't ask him about this?" I asked, incredulous. 

"It's not that simple," Mamie said. "He's... capricious, Jam. And powerful. He doesn't like being told what to do.  I can't control him, not even to ask him questions. Besides,  he's probably just playing a game. His own little game of gods and mortals." 

"You're saying I can't even ask him if he's behind this?" 

Mamie shrugged. "I'd recommend against it, Jam. You don't know Papa Legba like I do. Besides,  I think I have a better way to get our answers.  The tea leaves will tell us what we need to know." 

"The tea leaves?"  I asked, trying not to scoff.  "This is getting ridiculous." 

"Maybe," Mamie said, her eyes twinkling, "but it's how I roll."

I shook my head, thinking of the carnival fortune tellers down in New Orleans. They used to tell me about all the good times I was gonna have. Those were good times, if you were counting being shot at by a bunch of disgruntled ghouls. I’d taken a bullet or two from those guys.

"Look, Mamie, I appreciate the effort. You're a good woman, but this whole tea-leaf business is a little..."

I was about to say "ridiculous", but Charlaine kicked me under the table. Hard. I winced. She wasn't usually one for violence, especially not against an old lady. I gave her a questioning look, but she just shook her head. "Go on, Mamie," she said.

"It's not as simple as it looks," Mamie continued, her voice softer now, "It's not just about the leaves, Jam. It's about the connection. The crossroads god, he’s... picky about who he talks to."

"He's got an ear for the right kind of flattery," I thought. I just shook my head instead. "Look, Mamie, I just don’t buy into this whole spirit world thing. You know that. But what if it is Papa Legba? What if he really is behind all this? How do we even ask him?"

Mamie took a deep breath and looked at Charlaine, not at me. "The tea leaves are a bridge, a way to tune your mind. Not just to hear him, but to feel him." 

I scoffed. "So, you're telling me this is some kind of mystical mind-control trick? How's this gonna help? We gotta go after the Murder Twins, not some god with a taste for riddles!"

Mamie sighed. "No, Jam. We need to ask. He's the only one who knows why that doll's doing what it’s doing, and why the kid is sick."  

"But," I said. "You just said he's picky. What if he doesn't wanna talk?"

"He'll talk," Mamie said, "if we know how to ask."

I sighed. It was like arguing with a ghost. I took a swig of my coffee, already cold, and wished I was back at the station. "Alright, Mamie, lay it on me. How do we talk to this...crossroads god?" 

Mamie smiled, a glimmer of mischief in her eyes. She grabbed a teacup from the table and poured the remaining tea into a saucer. The leaves scattered across the white porcelain, forming a cryptic pattern. "He likes things simple, Jam. Nothing fancy, just a little respect." She picked up a couple of leaves, twirling them between her fingers. "He’s a crossroads man, a mediator. He's all about the balance, the give and take. You gotta offer him something."

“Yeah, yeah, I got it. Like a bribe," I said, already picturing Krabat’s crooked smile, “You know, the kind of favors you can get from a guy who owns a curio shop."  

“Not quite a bribe,” she said,  “More like a sacrifice. Something precious, something that holds value to you. The right offering, it’ll make his ears perk up.” She took a small wooden box from her purse, a hand-carved intricately detailed thing that I knew she’d been carrying for years.  

I had a hunch about what was in that box. I couldn't help but feel a pang of sadness. “What’s in that box, Mamie?”  

“A token of your intentions,” she said,  “The promise of something you’ll do if he helps. It doesn't have to be anything big. Just something important to you."   

“Look Mamie, I appreciate you trying to help, but I’m not cutting off my pinky finger or anything."  

"Don't be silly, Jam," she said,  “You’re not making a pact with the devil. Just a deal with a… crossroads god. There's a difference.”

“I don’t know, Mamie. I’m gonna need a lot more convincing than that.”  

“Okay, listen,” she said, her voice suddenly serious,  “There’s something wrong with that kid. It's more than just a regular illness. And the only one who can help is Papa Legba. He’s the only one who knows why the Murder Twins went after him, and why that doll’s doing what it's doing."  

“Look, Mamie, if this is gonna be a spiritual intervention, I’ll pass. I’m Sheriff of this town, not some voodoo priest.” 

“Jam,” she said, placing a hand on my arm, “It's a matter of time before those twins find another target. You know they're gonna get back to Shadow Falls. If we don’t stop them, we'll be dealing with more than just a sick kid. It'll be a full-blown crisis.”  

Charlaine was standing beside Mamie, her dark eyes fixed on me. She hadn't said a word during the entire conversation, but she had this serious look on her face. It was that look she got when she was about to use her grandmother’s tricks on some poor sap who’d found himself in trouble with the supernatural. I knew that look. I’d seen it a hundred times before, and I knew it was for real.  

I sighed. I looked at the tea leaves in the saucer, then at Charlaine, then back at Mamie. “Alright, Mamie,” I said, “Just one question.  If this Papa Legba really wants to help, why can’t he just show up himself? Why does he need to hide behind this tea leaf ritual?  

Mamie smiled, her eyes twinkling. “That’s the trick, Jam. He can’t always show up as himself. It’s all about the balance. Sometimes, you need to ask for help in a way that he can understand. Sometimes, you need to offer something in return. You need to be willing to give a little, in order to get a little.” 

I looked back at the tea leaves. There wasn’t much to see, really. Just a bunch of soggy leaves in a puddle of tea. But Mamie said that the crossroads god was picky.  Maybe, just maybe, he preferred his offerings presented on a saucer.
