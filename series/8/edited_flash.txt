I turned the corner onto Maple Lane. The streetlamps flickered as we drove past. The town was quiet, the air thick with the scent of pine and something else, something metallic and sharp. It made me think of blood. I was starting to get that feeling again. Like something was wrong. Like something was about to go down.

Charlaine stared at the empty road, her eyes filled with a distant look. 

"Jam, what was that... thing? The doll?"

I shrugged. "Just a little something I picked up from the pawn shop," I said, hoping she wouldn't push it any further. Charlaine was a good girl, but she needed a moment or two without me piling more crap onto her plate.

Her grandmother was a different story, though. The old woman was a manbo, a Voodoo priestess. She had a thing for these kinds of things. A knack for the occult. A taste for the strange.

We'd find her in the town pharmacy, where she'd been a fixture for as long as I could remember. The old lady was always up late, working her magic.

The place reeked of lavender and old medicine. It was the only place in town where the scent of peppermint was stronger than the smell of maple syrup. Charlaine's grandma had a nose for herbs and a way with a mortar and pestle that would make you think she was brewing up some kind of magical elixir.

Charlaine stared at me, her eyes wide. “What’s going on, Jam?”

"We need to talk to your grandma, Charlaine. We need to know what she knows. What she's done. What's about to happen."

“But I don't understand. Why would she..." My deputy's expression hardened, as she put two and two together. Her chin lifted defiantly. "We're going to see her, Jam. But I ain’t gonna let you talk to her like she’s some kind of suspect."

“This isn’t just about your grandma, Charlaine. It’s about Shadow Falls. The twins. Krabat. Anna… everyone. I wouldn’t want to accuse her of anything. We just need to find out what’s going on."

My deputy sighed. "Fine. But I'll do the talking."

We rattled on the door of the pharmacy. It was locked, and the lights were out. Suddenly,the door creaked open. "Jam? Charlaine? What are you doing here, at this hour?"

Her voice was raspy, like she’d just woken up from a dream, or maybe from a long sleep. A candle illuminated the old woman, but I could still see the tired lines etched around her eyes. They were the kind of lines that tell a story, the kind that have been carved by years of laughter and tears, by nights spent under a moonlit sky and mornings spent under the watchful gaze of the sunrise.

“We need to talk, Mamie,” I said, my voice as steady as I could manage.

“Couldn’t this wait for tomorrow?”

“Not this time, grand-mere,” Charlaine said. My deputy stepped past me, into the shop. The air inside felt thick with the smell of spices. Ginger, cinnamon, sage, and of course clover. The shelves were lined with jars and bottles, each one filled with something that promised a cure, or maybe just a little bit of magic.

"I know about the doll, grand-mere. I know what it means. I know what you've done."

The old woman smiled, but it wasn’t a friendly smile. "Well, now, Charlaine. I wouldn't go accusing your grandma of anything."

I took a step forward, but Charlaine grabbed my arm, her grip firm. I staid silent. “We’re not here to accuse. We’re here to understand."

Mamie’s gaze lingered on Charlaine, her eyes as deep as the old mahogany countertop she rested her hand upon. Her smile faltered, replaced by a weariness that settled like a fog in the room. The air hummed with a barely perceptible energy, a low thrum that danced around her like a swarm of unseen insects. A silver amulet, intricately carved with swirling patterns, hung from her neck, catching the dim light in a mesmerizing dance.

“Long night?” Mamie’s voice was a sigh, a whisper of the wind that rustled through the leaves of the ancient maple tree outside. “I suspect it’s been a long night for a while now, dearie.”

“The kind that brings out the shadows, Mamie,” Charlaine said. She met her grandmother’s gaze. “And the shadows have started to play.”

Mamie's gaze drifted towards the back of the shop, her eyes seeming to pierce the darkness. The smell of old herbs, pungent and earthy, intensified as if the air itself was holding its breath. "Play? Is that what you call it? They’re not playing, Charlaine. They’re dancing. And they’re coming for us all.”

Mamie turned and shuffled toward the back of the shop, her steps slow but purposeful. The air grew thicker with the scent of herbs and something else… something ancient and primal.

I looked at Charlaine, her eyes shining in the dimly lit room. Then I looked back at Mamie, who was now returning with two steaming cups of tea. She set it on the counter, a gentle smile gracing her lips. 

“Drink your tea. You look like you could use it.”

I took the cup, the steam warming my face. The tea was sweet and spicy, a familiar comfort in this world of shadows and whispers. But the comfort was fleeting.

Charlaine brought her grandmother up to speed about the murders, the vanishing twins, and her own abduction. Mamie’s gaze lingered on Charlaine, her eyes dark and knowing. I saw the fury in her eyes when my deputy talked about her kidnapping. Clearly, old voodoo priestess had no love for anyone moving against her old flesh and blood.

"So," I said, trying to sound casual, "who's got a hand in this? The doll, the crossroads magic, the whole shebang. You said this was a powerful spell, Mamie."

Mamie's smile faded. Her eyes, normally a bright brown, turned a shade darker. "It's not just crossroads magic, Jam. It's... well, it's beyond Papa Legba's work."

I blinked. "Beyond? It was Legba who put me onto the right track. Who told me where to find the blasted doll."

Mamie didn't answer right away. She looked at my deputy, then back at me. "He's got a vested interest in Charlaine. He's always been watching her, waiting for her to come into her own. She is going to be a powerful manbo one day. Also, I made a deal with him to acquire some extra... protection for my family."

I stared at Charlaine, who was staring back at me with a look of pure confusion. "Did you know about this?" I asked her.

"Not really," Charlaine said. "I just...I felt different lately. Stronger, more alive. And I've had these...visions. Like flashes of the past, of the future, of something I don't even understand."

"And you're sure it's not Papa Legba?" I asked Mamie.

"I'm not sure about anything," Mamie admitted. "But there's a feeling. A presence, like a shadow. Like dancing over your own grave."

My gut twisted. I knew who she was referring to, and my clay didn't like the sound of it. 

"So, you're saying a different Voodoo god is trying to pull the strings? Why?"

Mamie shrugged. "Who knows? Maybe he's trying to test Charlaine. Or maybe he's got something else in mind."

"Maybe you could ask him?" I said. "You know him, right?"

Mamie chuckled. "Jam, I don't know the loa of death very well. I'm just a humble woman who knows how to read tea leaves."

"You're telling me that Baron Samedi might be behind all of this but we can't ask him directly?"

Mamie shrugged. "I'd recommend against it, Jam. You don't know the loa like I do. Besides, I think I have a better way to get our answers. The tea leaves will tell us what we need to know."

"The tea leaves?" I asked, trying not to scoff. "This is getting ridiculous."

"Maybe," Mamie said, her eyes twinkling, "but it's how I roll."

I shook my head, thinking of the carnival fortune tellers that used to come by in th 1800s. They used to tell me about all the good times I was gonna have. Those were good times, if you were counting being shot at by a bunch of disgruntled ghouls.

"Look, Mamie, I appreciate the effort. You're a good woman, but this whole tea-leaf business is a little..."

I was about to say "ridiculous", but Charlaine kicked me under the counter. Hard. I winced. She wasn't usually one for violence, especially not against an old lady. I gave her a questioning look, but she just shook her head. "Go on, Mamie," she said.

"It's not as simple as it looks," Mamie continued, her voice softer now, "It's not just about the leaves, Jam. It's about the connection. The crossroads god, he’s... picky about who he talks to."

"Didn't seem so picky when he talked to me," I thought. I just shook my head instead. "Look, Mamie, I just don’t buy into this whole spirit world thing. You know that."

Mamie took a deep breath and looked at Charlaine, not at me. "The tea leaves are a bridge, a way to tune your mind. Not just to hear the spirits, but to feel them."

"What if they don't wanna talk?" Charlaine looked almost as doubtful as myself.

"They'll talk," Mamie said, "if we know how to ask."

I sighed. It was like arguing with a ghost. I wished I was back at the station. "Alright, Mamie, lay it on us. What do we need to do?"

Mamie smiled, a glimmer of mischief in her eyes. She grabbed a teacup from the table and poured the remaining tea into a saucer. The leaves scattered across the white porcelain, forming a cryptic pattern. "Elegba likes things simple, Jam. Nothing fancy, just a little respect." She picked up a couple of leaves, twirling them between her fingers. "He’s a crossroads man, a mediator. He's all about the balance, the give and take. You gotta offer him something."

“Yeah, yeah, I got it. Like a bribe," I said, already picturing Krabat’s crooked smile, “You know, the kind of favors you can get from a guy who owns a curio shop."

“Not quite a bribe,” she said, “More like a sacrifice. Something precious, something that holds value to you. The right offering, it’ll make his ears perk up.” She took a small wooden box from her purse, a hand-carved intricately detailed thing that I knew she’d been carrying for years.

I had a hunch about what was in that box. I couldn't help but feel a pang of sadness. “What’s in that box, Mamie?”

“A token of your intentions,” she said, “The promise of something you’ll do if he helps. It doesn't have to be anything big. Just something important to you."

“Look Mamie, I appreciate you trying to help, but I’m not cutting off my pinky finger or anything."

"Don't be silly, Jam," she said, “You’re not making a pact with the devil. Just a deal with a… crossroads god. There's a difference.”

Charlaine was standing beside Mamie, her dark eyes fixed on me. She hadn't said a word during the entire conversation, but she had this serious look on her face. It was that look she got when she was about to use her grandmother’s tricks on some poor sap who’d found himself in trouble with the supernatural. I knew that look. I’d seen it a hundred times before, and I knew it was for real.

I sighed. I looked at the tea leaves in the saucer, then at Charlaine, then back at Mamie. “Alright, Mamie,” I said. I took the rosette out of the wallet. My own, not the one we found in the basement. It had been in my wallet for years. I hope that was important enough.

Mamie smiled, her eyes twinkling. “That’s the trick, Jam. Now, Elegba won't always show up as himself. It’s all about the balance. Sometimes, you need to ask for help in a way that he can understand. Sometimes, you need to offer something in return. You need to be willing to give a little, in order to get a little.”

I looked back at the tea leaves. There wasn’t much to see, really. Just a bunch of soggy leaves in a puddle of tea. But Mamie said that the crossroads god was picky. Maybe, just maybe, he preferred his offerings presented on a saucer.
