I found Anna in her office, the place still a mess, but she'd at least managed to clean up the guest chair and enough of the desk to have space for my pot of steaming coffee. I drank directly from the pot, not bothering to transfer it into a mug. 

"So, that's it," I said, putting down the pot. "That's what happened."

Anna looked up from her paperwork, her bloodshot eyes narrowed. "And then he told you to come here before I open the mail?"

"Yeah," I said. "He said he needed my help. He wants me to find someone for him."

"Who?"

"He didn't say. Just that it was someone dear to a follower of his."

Anna sighed, running a hand through her black hair. "This is getting complicated."

"Tell me about it," I said. "I'm starting to think this whole town is cursed."

"Maybe it is," Anna said. "But we're not giving up, are we?"

I shrugged. "Not yet."

"Good," Anna said. "Because I have a feeling we're going to need all the help we can get."

"Yeah, well, I'm not sure we're getting any help from the guy who just sent me on a wild goose chase." I took another swig of coffee, the bitter taste a welcome distraction from the knot in my gut. "Charlaine's gone, Krabat's gone, and now this old voodoo dude wants me to find them both."

Anna's eyes narrowed. "He wants you to find them both?"

"Technically, he only said Charlaine. I'm pretty sure he doesn't give a damn about Krabat." I leaned back in the chair, the creaking wood a familiar sound in this office. "He's probably just using me to get to Charlaine. She's the one with the magic, the one who can actually talk to him."

"But why?" Anna asked, her voice low. "Why would he want her back?"

"Beats me," I said. "Maybe he wants to use her to get to something else. Maybe he wants to use her to get to you."

Anna's eyes widened. "Me?"

"Yeah, you," I said. "He's got a thing for you, you know. He's always trying to get you to do his bidding."

"He's just trying to help," Anna said, her voice defensive. "He's just trying to make sure I'm safe."

"Yeah, right," I said. "He's just trying to get his hooks into you. He's a trickster, Anna. He's not to be trusted."

Anna sighed, her shoulders slumping. "I know, Jam. I know."

"So, what are we going to do?" I asked. "We can't just sit here and wait for him to make his move."

"We need to find Charlaine," Anna said. "We need to find her before he does."

"And we need to figure out what Krabat's up to," I said. "He's always got something going on. He's always got a scheme in the works."

"We'll figure it out," Anna said. "We always do."

I looked at her, her face pale in the dim light of the office. I knew she was trying to be strong, but I could see the fear in her eyes. I knew she was scared, just like I was. But we had to be strong. We had to find Charlaine. We had to stop Krabat. We had to protect Shadow Falls.

Anna sighed and pulled a little flask out of her drawer. Before I could intervene, she took a swig. She noticed the expression on my face and told me to relax. "Just pig's blood," she said, "Tastes like crap, but at least it's not addictive." I shrugged. "Old habits die hard," I said. "Even after years." Anna nodded and pointed at her fifty-year chip. "One day at a time," she said.

I took another sip of coffee. "So, what do you make of it all?" I asked. 

Anna looked at me, her bloodshot eyes narrowed. "Krabat's as much a victim as Charlaine," she said. "He's been used."

I knew she was right. I'd had my suspicions about Krabat for years. He was always a slippery character, always playing both sides. But this encounter proved he wasn't behind this. His magic was different, darker. 

"You think so?" I asked. 

"I know so," she said. "His magic is rooted in the old world, in the dark arts. This is something else, something more primal."

I didn't argue. I knew she was right. But I still had my doubts. Krabat was a dangerous man, and I wasn't ready to trust him just yet. 

"Well, whatever it is," I said, "we need to find out who's behind it." 

Anna nodded. "We need to find out who's pulling the strings."

Anna's words hung in the air, heavy with unspoken worry. I took another drag from my cigarette, the smoke curling towards the ceiling like a question mark. "Yeah, well, that's the million-dollar question, ain't it?"

"I still don't understand Legba's involvement," she said, her voice a low murmur. "If he was behind this, why would he task you to find Charlaine? Why not just do it himself?"

I shrugged. "Maybe he's got a thing for playing games."

"Or maybe he's not behind it at all," she said. "Maybe he's just using this to his advantage."

I knew she was right. Legba was a trickster, a master of manipulation. He could be playing both sides, using this whole mess to his own ends. But something about his words, the way he looked at me, made me think he was telling the truth.

"He didn't admit to anything," I said. "He just didn't deny it."

"That's just like him," Anna said. "Always playing coy."

"Yeah, well, that's what makes him so damn dangerous," I said. "You never know what he's up to."

"But if he didn't do it himself," Anna said, "that means he couldn't directly interfere. Why?"

I thought about it. "Maybe there's different factions in his cult," I said. "Maybe he can't play favorites."

"Or maybe," Anna said, her voice barely a whisper, "there's another deity involved."

I shivered. The thought of another god, another power, playing in the shadows, sent a chill down my spine. This was getting bigger than I ever imagined.

We sat there for a while, the silence thick as the smoke from my cigarette. Anna finally broke the spell. "So, this guy sends you on a quest but doesn't give you any help? No godly weapon or a magic compass that shows you the way?"

I nodded. "All he told me was to come to City Hall before you opened your mail."

Anna looked at the half dozen letters on her desk. She sighed and grabbed a letter opener. "Let's get to it, then." She reached for the first letter.
