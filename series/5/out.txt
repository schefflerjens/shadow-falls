"And then he told me to come here before you open the mail."

Anna sat across from me, her face pale, her eyes bloodshot. She was trying to hide them behind her sunglasses, but I could see the strain in her face. She was tired, and I knew why. She hadn't slept in days. She was worried about Charlaine.

"He wants me to find someone for him," I said, taking a swig of coffee from the pot. "Someone who's dear to a follower of his."

Anna sighed, her shoulders slumping. "That's not good. He's not known for his kindness."

"He's not known for his kindness," I agreed, putting the pot down. "But he's not known for his patience either. He wants me to find this person, and he wants me to do it fast."

"What do you think we should do?"

I shrugged. "I don't know. But I know one thing. We need to find Charlaine. And we need to find her fast."

Anna's words hung in the air, heavy with worry. I knew she was right. Charlaine was gone, vanished without a trace. Krabat was gone too, so I guess it wasn't all bad. 

"So, here's the deal," I said, leaning back in my chair. "That old geezer, Papa Legba, he wants me to find someone. He says if I do, he'll help us get Charlaine and Krabat back."

Anna's eyes narrowed. "He's playing us, Jam. He's always playing us."

"Maybe," I said, "but he's also the only one who knows where Charlaine is. And he's the only one who can get Krabat back."

"What do we know about this person?" Anna asked, her voice tight.

"Not much," I said, pulling out a crumpled piece of paper from my pocket. "He gave me this. It's a name, a date, and a place. That's it."

I handed the paper to Anna. She scanned it quickly, her brow furrowed. "This is a long shot, Jam. This person, they're from the 1800s. They're probably dead."

"Maybe," I said, "but we gotta try. We gotta find this person, and we gotta find them fast."

Anna sighed, her shoulders slumping. "Fine. But I'm not holding my breath."

I knew she was right. This was a long shot, a desperate gamble. But it was the only shot we had. I looked at the paper in my hand, the name, the date, the place. It was a clue, a thread in a tangled web. And I was determined to follow it, no matter where it led.

Anna sighed, her shoulders slumping. "Fine. But I'm not holding my breath." I knew she was right. This was a long shot, a desperate gamble. But it was the only shot we had. I looked at the paper in my hand, the name, the date, the place. It was a clue, a thread in a tangled web. And I was determined to follow it, no matter where it led. 

Anna pulled a little flask out of her desk drawer. Before I could say anything, she took a swig. She noticed the expression on my face and gave me a wry smile. "Relax, Jam. It's just pig's blood. Tastes like crap, but at least it's not addictive." I shrugged. "Old habits die hard, even after years." She nodded, pointing at her fifty-year chip. "One day at a time."

Anna took another swig of the blood, grimaced, and put the flask back in her drawer. I took another sip of coffee, the bitter taste a welcome contrast to the blood's metallic tang. "So, what do you make of it?" I asked, tapping the paper on the desk. 

Anna leaned back in her chair, her eyes narrowed. "Krabat's a victim, just like Charlaine."

I raised an eyebrow. "You think so?"

"He's not the one who's been messing with Voodoo. His magic's different, Jam. You know that."

I knew she was right. Krabat's magic was more European, more...dark. But I still had my doubts. "He's got a lot of enemies, Anna. And he's not exactly known for his charity."

"He's got a lot of enemies because he's powerful, Jam. Not because he's evil. And he's not the one who's been messing with Charlaine's kit."

I didn't say anything. I knew Anna was right. Krabat was a manipulator, a master of the dark arts, but he wasn't a fool. He wouldn't risk his neck for something like this. But I still couldn't shake the feeling that something wasn't right.

"Look, Jam," Anna said, her voice softer now. "I know you've got your suspicions about Krabat. But this proves he's not behind this. Trust me."

I sighed. "I'll trust you, Anna. But I'm still keeping an eye on him."

She smiled, a flicker of something in her eyes. "You always do, Jam. You always do."

You always do." 

Anna's smile was a little too bright, a little too knowing. I didn't like it. I didn't like the way she was looking at me, like she knew something I didn't. 

"What about Legba?" I asked, trying to keep my voice even. "He's the one who's been messing with Charlaine's kit, right?"

Anna shrugged. "I don't know, Jam. He's a trickster, a god of crossroads. You can't always trust what he says."

"He didn't say anything," I countered. "He just didn't deny it."

"Exactly," Anna said. "He's playing a game, Jam. He's always playing a game."

I stared at the paper on the desk, the faded ink blurring in my vision. Legba. The god of crossroads. A trickster. A manipulator. And he was involved in this mess, somehow.

"Why would he task me to find someone?" I asked, my voice a low growl. "Why not just do it himself?"

Anna's eyes narrowed. "Maybe he can't. Maybe there are things even a god can't do."

"Or maybe he wants to see what I'll do," I said, my voice tight. "Maybe he wants to see if I'm worthy."

Anna didn't answer. She just sat there, her eyes fixed on me, her expression unreadable.

"I don't like this, Anna," I said, my voice rough. "I don't like the way this is all playing out."

"Neither do I, Jam," she said, her voice soft. "But we have to play the hand we're dealt."

I looked at her, at the dark circles under her eyes, the faint tremor in her hands. She was tired, just like me. We were both caught in a game we didn't understand, a game with stakes we couldn't afford to lose.

"I'm going to find him," I said, my voice firm. "I'm going to find the one Legba wants saved."

Anna nodded, her eyes filled with a strange mix of fear and hope. "I know you will, Jam. You always do."

You always do." 

Silence hung in the air, thick and heavy like the fog that rolled in from the bay every morning. Anna's words echoed in the room, a reminder of the weight of responsibility that rested on my shoulders. I stared at the half dozen letters on her desk, each one a potential clue, a potential danger. 

"So, this guy sends you on a quest but doesn't give you any details?" Anna asked, her voice laced with a hint of disbelief. "No godly weapon or a magic compass that shows you the way?"

I nodded, my gaze fixed on the letters. "All he said was to come to City Hall before you opened your mail."

Anna sighed, her hand reaching for a letter opener. "Let's get to it, then." She picked up the first letter, her fingers tracing the elegant script on the envelope. "Maybe there's a clue in here somewhere."

I watched her, my heart a drum in my chest. The air in the room felt charged, thick with anticipation. This was it. The start of a game, a game that could change everything.

Anna picked up the first letter on her desk. It was a standard business envelope, cream-colored and plain. No return address, just a single, ordinary stamp. The only thing out of the ordinary was that it had a wax seal. Beyond that, it looked utterly unremarkable, the kind of envelope that gets buried under a pile of bills and forgotten. 

Anna held the letter up to the light, her eyes narrowed. "This is it, Jam. The first move." 

I leaned back in my chair, my gaze fixed on her. "What's the seal?"

"Looks like a raven," she said, her voice low. "A black raven with its wings spread wide."

"A raven," I muttered, my mind racing. "That's a bad omen, isn't it?"

Anna shrugged. "Maybe. Or maybe it's just a fancy way to say 'get ready to play.'"

She broke the seal with a flick of her wrist, the wax cracking like brittle bone. Inside, a single sheet of paper, folded in thirds. She unfolded it slowly, her eyes scanning the text. 

"It's a riddle," she said, her voice barely a whisper. "A riddle about a lost treasure."

"A treasure?" I scoffed. "What kind of treasure?"

"The letter doesn't say," she replied, her eyes still fixed on the paper. "But it does say that the treasure is hidden somewhere in Shadow Falls."

"And that's it?" I asked, my voice laced with skepticism. "Just a riddle about a treasure?"

"Just a riddle," she said, her voice a little sharper now. "But a riddle that could lead us to something big, something dangerous."

I stared at her, my gut churning. This was no ordinary game. This was something else, something dark and dangerous. And I had a feeling that I was about to be dragged into the middle of it.

Anna held the envelope close to the desk lamp, scrutinizing it from all angles. It looked completely ordinary, even under the harsh light. With a sigh, she decided to just open it. As her finger pressed down on the seal, a faint click resonated from within the envelope. Before we could react, a muffled pop echoed through the office. A shimmering cloud of multicolored glitter erupted from the envelope, momentarily blinding us. 

I coughed, my eyes watering. "What the hell was that?"

Anna shielded her eyes with her hand. "I don't know," she said, her voice strained. "But it's not glitter."

The glitter settled, revealing a new message scrawled across the paper in a swirling, iridescent ink. It read: "The Raven's Eye sees all, but the Serpent's Tongue speaks truth."

"What does that mean?" I asked, my voice tight.

Anna stared at the message, her brow furrowed. "I don't know," she said, her voice low. "But I have a bad feeling about this." 

I looked at her, my gut churning. This was no ordinary game. This was something else, something dark and dangerous. And I had a feeling that I was about to be dragged into the middle of it.

Jam sputtered, "What theâ€¦", coughing a cloud of glitter out of his mouth. Anna blinked rapidly, waving away the sparkling dust. "Glitter bomb?" she asked incredulously.

We looked back at the envelope, now lying split open on the desk. The interior was still plain, no hidden compartments, no scorching marks. Just harmless, sparkly chaos. But beneath the glitter, nestled in the folds of the envelope, lay a tiny, intricately carved wooden doll. On the smooth back of the doll, a single name was etched in a delicate script -- Charlaine Meyers.

"What the hell?" I muttered, picking up the doll. It was cold to the touch, and the wood felt strangely alive beneath my fingers.

Anna leaned closer, her eyes narrowed. "This isn't a toy," she said, her voice low. "This is a voodoo doll."

I felt a chill run down my spine. I knew about voodoo. I'd seen enough of it in Shadow Falls to know that it wasn't something to be trifled with.

"Who sent this?" I asked, my voice tight.

Anna shook her head. "I don't know," she said. "But whoever it is, they're playing a dangerous game."

I looked at the doll, then back at Anna. "We need to find Charlaine," I said. "And we need to find out who sent this."

Anna nodded, her face grim. "I agree," she said. "But we need to be careful. This could be a trap."

I knew she was right. This was something else, something dark and dangerous. And I had a feeling that I was about to be dragged into the middle of it.

I picked up the doll again, turning it over in my hands. It was small, no bigger than my thumb, but it felt heavy, almost alive. I looked at Anna, her eyes wide with concern. "What do we do?" she asked. I shrugged. "I don't know," I said. "But I have a feeling this doll is going to tell us something." I put the doll back on the table. It lay still for a moment, then started to turn. Slowly, almost imperceptibly, it rotated about forty-five degrees to the left. I watched it, my breath catching in my throat. I rotated the doll back to its original position. It turned again, back to the same spot. "I guess there's our magic compass," I said, a nervous laugh escaping my lips.

Charlaine grabbed an empty petri dish from her kit and laid the tiny doll inside of it. She got up and walked across the room, the doll spinning in the dish. It kept pointing in the same direction, like a home-made water compass. She handed the dish to me. "Go bring them back," she said. 

"Bring who back?" I asked. 

"The kids," she said. "The ones who were playing with the doll." 

I looked at the doll, then back at Charlaine. "You think this thing is going to lead us to them?" 

"It's worth a shot," she said. "Besides, what else are we going to do?" 

I sighed. "Fine," I said. "But if this is a wild goose chase, I'm blaming you." 

I took the petri dish and headed out the door. The doll spun in the dish, pointing me towards the old abandoned mill on the outskirts of town. I knew that place. It was a haven for the town's outcasts, a place where the shadows were always a little deeper, the whispers a little louder. 

I wasn't looking forward to it, but I knew I had to go. The kids were missing, and I was the only one who could find them.
