The leaves in the saucer spun wildly, then halted abruptly. A chill crept through the room. The air thickened, pressing against my clay skin.

I scanned the shadows. Nothing. Just the same old knick-knacks and voodoo paraphernalia.

"Alright, enough theatrics. Show yourself, Daddy Longlegs."

"I still wish you wouldn't call me that." 

Anna's voice. But not quite. She emerged from the darkness, swaying slightly. Her eyes glowed an unnatural green.

"Sheriff Slate." The voice that came from Anna's mouth was chilling, unfamiliar. "And the esteemed Mama Marie. Your offerings and hospitality are... appreciated."

"Get out of her," I growled. "Find your own meat puppet."

A laugh, low and guttural. "I can only manifest at the crossroads between life and death. A vampire serves nicely."

Mama Marie nodded. "Asked the mayor here for that very reason. She volunteered."

"How thoughtful," I muttered.

Legba's gaze fixed on me. "Our deal is complete, Sheriff. The person you rescued was the one you sought."

"Not so fast." I stood, ignoring Charlaine's warning glance. "You promised me something I'd been searching for. Someone isn't something. You're still in my debt."

Silence fell. Outside, wind howled. The lights flickered, and thunder shook the house. Lightning cracked, followed by an explosion.

Charlaine kicked me. "Stop pissing off deities," she hissed.

Then, as suddenly as it started, everything went quiet. Only Cerberus's whining and Legba's laughter remained.

"Clever, clever," Legba said, grinning with Anna's fangs. "Rare for a trickster god to be outsmarted. English is... tricky. But game recognizes game." He spread Anna's arms wide. "Name your price, Sheriff. Within reason. What do you truly desire? Remember, there's always a cost at the crossroads."

I paused, weighing my options carefully. This was my shot. I couldn't waste it.

"Someone" was off the table. So was Krabat's location. Asking about the Murder Twins' boss? Useless if they were holed up in some Tibetan monastery.

I ran a hand over my face, feeling the clay shift beneath my fingers. Think, Jam. Think.

The answer hit me like a sledgehammer.

"I'm searching for a way to stop the source of the killings from committing any further killings, abductions, or other crimes in and around Shadow Falls, without any more citizens coming to harm in the process."

Legba's borrowed eyes narrowed. "Very specific, Sheriff. Lots of constraints. Hard to fulfill."

"Can't do it?"

Thunder cracked outside. Charlaine's foot connected with my shin. Again.

Legba chuckled, a sound that didn't belong in Anna's throat. "It can be done. But you might not like the outcome." He grinned with Anna's fangs. "Then again, giving what's asked for but not what's needed? On brand for me."

I waited, tension coiling in my clay muscles.

"Go back to city hall. Wait for the clock to strike noon."

Before I could respond, Legba turned to Mama Marie. "Your kin's been safely returned. Ready to fulfill your part?"

Marie nodded, a resigned look in her eyes.

It happened fast. Too fast.

Legba lunged forward, Anna's vampire speed on full display. Fangs sank into Marie's neck.

I moved to intervene, but my clay limbs felt like lead. Charlaine's scream pierced the air.

Blood flowed. Magic crackled. And all I could do was watch.
