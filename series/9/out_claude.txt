The leaves in the saucer spun faster, then stopped dead. A chill crept through the room. Sweat beaded on my clay skin. Charlaine's breath hitched. Mama Marie's eyes gleamed in the candlelight.

I scanned the shadows. Nothing. Silence pressed in, heavy as a gravestone.

"Alright, enough theatrics. Show yourself, Daddy Longlegs."

A voice from the darkness. "I still wish you wouldn't call me that."

Anna stepped into the circle of candlelight. But it wasn't Anna. Not really. Her eyes glowed an unnatural green. She swayed like a cobra ready to strike.

When she spoke, it wasn't her voice. It was older. Deeper. It sent ice through my veins.

"Sheriff Slate. Always a pleasure." The thing wearing Anna's face turned to Mama Marie. "And you, old friend. Your offerings are appreciated. Your hospitality... exemplary."

My fists clenched. "Get out of her, Legba."

Those alien eyes fixed on me. "Now, now. Don't be rude. I can only manifest at the crossroads of life and death. Like your grisly crime scene. Or a vampire - dead, yet alive."

Mama Marie chuckled. "That's why I asked the mayor here, child. She volunteered."

The possessed Anna smiled. It didn't reach those glowing eyes. "Indeed. Now, about our deal, Sheriff. Congratulations on your speedy delivery. The person you rescued was the one you sought. Our business is concluded."

I stood, chair scraping across worn floorboards. "Not so fast. You promised me something I'd been searching for. Someone isn't something. You're still in my debt, Legba."

The words hung in the air. Silence stretched like taffy. Then all hell broke loose.

Lightning cracked. Thunder shook the walls. The candles sputtered, casting wild shadows.

Charlaine's boot connected with my shin. "Stop pissing off deities," she hissed.

Another boom rattled the windows. Something outside exploded. The air crackled with ozone.

Then, just as suddenly, everything went quiet. Only Cerberus' whine and Legba's low chuckle broke the stillness.

"Well, well." The thing wearing Anna's face leaned back. "Color me impressed, Sheriff. It's rare for a trickster to be... outsmarted."

I kept my clay face neutral. Inside, I was sweating bullets.

Legba's stolen eyes gleamed. "English. Such a tricky tongue. But game recognizes game, as they say."

Anna's body shifted, predatory grace in every movement. "Name your price, Slate. Within reason, of course. What do you truly desire?"

I weighed my options. Asking about Krabat was out. So was the Murder Twins' boss - could be anyone, anywhere. I needed something concrete. Something to end this mess.

Legba's voice dropped low. "Remember, Sheriff. There's always a price at the crossroads."

I took a deep breath I didn't need. "I'm searching for a way to stop the source of the killings. No more deaths, no more disappearances. Not just in Shadow Falls, but the surrounding area too. And here's the kicker - I want it done without any more citizens getting hurt."

Legba's borrowed brow furrowed. "That's... very specific. Many constraints. It would be difficult to fulfill."

I leaned forward. "You saying you can't do it?"

Thunder cracked again. Charlaine's boot found my shin. Again.

Legba's laugh was all smoke and shadows. "It can be done. But you might not like the outcome."

The grin that spread across Anna's face was pure mischief. "Then again, giving what's asked for, not what's needed? That's on-brand for a trickster, isn't it?"

I didn't like the sound of that. Not one bit.

"Go to city hall," Legba said. "Be sure to arrive before dawn."

Before I could argue, Legba turned to Mama Marie. The old woman's eyes were calm, resigned.

"Your kin has been returned safely," Legba purred. "Are you prepared to fulfill your part of our bargain?"

Marie nodded once, chin held high.

It happened faster than I could blink. Legba lunged, Anna's fangs sinking deep into Marie's throat.

Charlaine screamed. I lurched forward, my clay limbs sluggish. Too slow. Always too damn slow.

Marie's eyes rolled back. Her body went limp. Legba drank deep, greedy gulps echoing in the candlelit room.

"Stop!" I bellowed.

Legba's stolen eyes flicked to me. Amused. Challenging. Blood trickled from Anna's chin.

I grabbed for my gun. Useless. What good were bullets against a god?

Charlaine's hand shot out, gripping my arm. "Don't," she hissed. "You'll make it worse."

The hut creaked. Shadows danced. Outside, Cerberus howled, low and mournful.

Legba released Marie. Her body crumpled to the floor. Charlaine rushed to her side, fingers pressed to her grandmother's neck.

"You bastard," I growled.

Legba wiped Anna's mouth with the back of her hand. "A deal's a deal, Sheriff. You of all people should understand that."

I clenched my fists. Clay cracked and reformed. "This wasn't part of it."

"Wasn't it?" Legba's stolen voice dripped honey and poison. "The price at the crossroads, remember? Everything has a cost. Mama Marie knew, and she gladly paid to keep her family safe."

Charlaine's voice, barely a whisper. "She's gone."

Legba stretched, catlike, in Anna's body. "Now, now. Don't look so glum. Nosferatu, remember? She'll be back... in a way."

"As a bloody vampire?" I snarled.

That damned smile again. "You'll see soon enough. Tick tock, Sheriff. Best hurry to city hall."

Thunder rumbled outside. The air crackled, heavy with ozone and something darker.

"Oh, and Slate?" Legba's eyes glittered. "You might want to bring your map."

A blinding flash. When my vision cleared, Anna's body lay crumpled on the floor. No sign of Legba.

Charlaine's voice, tight with fear. "Jam. We need to go. Now."

I looked at Marie, pale and still. At Anna, unconscious and vulnerable. At Charlaine, eyes wide with panic.

The clock on the wall ticked steadily. Thirty minutes to sunrise.

"Cerberus," I called. The hound's massive head appeared in the doorway. "Guard them. Both of them."

Charlaine stood, shoulders squared. "I'm coming with you."

"Like hell you are," I growled.

"My grandmother might be dying," she snapped. "Anna's out cold. Whatever's waiting at city hall, you shouldn't face it alone."

I opened my mouth to argue. Closed it. The kid had a point.

"Fine," I grunted. "But you follow my lead."

We stepped out into the storm-dark day. Thunder rolled across the sky. The air smelled of rain and something metallic. Dread coiled in my gut.

Twenty-five minutes to noon. Whatever Legba had set in motion, we were racing against the clock.

And I had a sinking feeling we were already too late.
