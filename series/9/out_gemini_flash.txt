The leaves in the saucer spun, a dizzying dance, then abruptly stilled. The room chilled, the air growing heavy. My skin crawled. I couldn't see anything, but I felt it. A presence, shifting in the shadows. It was like the air itself had grown sentient, a watchful, knowing eye peering down at us.

Mama Marie remained calm, her eyes fixed on the leaves. "He's here," she repeated, a whisper like the wind through dry leaves.  "He hears." 

I assumed she meant Papa Legba, the trickster god, mediator between worlds. But where was he? We hadn't heard his booming laughter, or seen the flash of his cane in the flickering candlelight. I glanced at Charlaine, her hand already tightening around her silver charm. The air felt thick, electric. 

"You better show your face, Daddy Longlegs," I growled, my voice a challenge in the stillness. "It's not polite to eavesdrop."

A chuckle echoed from the darkness, a sound that sent shivers down my spine. It was a dry, brittle sound, like the rustle of old bones. "I still wish you wouldn't call me that," the voice rasped. It was close, right behind me. I could feel the air shift, the shadows dance. 

Charlaine, her eyes wide, took a step back, but her hand never left the silver charm. My fingers twitched, reaching for my gun. It wasn't a gun, technically. I was a golem, after all. But my hand still knew the feel of the cold metal, the reassuring weight in my palm. 

"Maybe you're just not a very good listener, then," I growled. I shifted in my chair, trying to catch a glimpse of whatever lurked in the shadows. "If you're here, make yourself known. We ain't got all day."

A gust of cold air swept through the room, and the scent of damp earth filled my nostrils. Then, from the corner, a figure emerged. It was Anna, our mayor and town doctor, but something was different. Her usually composed gait was unsteady, almost drunken. Her eyes glowed a vibrant green, flickering with an unholy light. Her voice, usually a soothing melody, was now a chilling rasp. 

"Jam Slate, Sheriff of Shadow Falls. Your reputation precedes you. Mama Marie," she continued, her words laced with a strange reverence, "you have a heart of gold. Thank you for your offerings, for your hospitality." 

A wave of nausea washed over me. Anna wouldn't use those words, not in a million years. This wasn't my friend, my confidante, the woman I secretly yearned for. This was something else entirely. It was Papa Legba, the trickster god, possessing her. 

"Get out of her, Daddy Longlegs," I snarled, my fists clenched. "This ain't your playground." 

"My dear Jam," Legba's voice slithered through Anna's lips, "you misunderstand. I can only manifest at the crossroads between life and death." His gaze swept over the room, landing on the still leaves in the saucer. "Like that warehouse, where the soul of a man lingered, caught between this world and the next."  He paused, the green light in Anna's eyes flickering. "And a vampire, Sheriff, dead yet alive, is a crossroads of sorts, wouldn't you agree?"

Mama Marie's voice was a calm whisper in the sudden tension. "I called him here, Jam. I needed his counsel." She looked at Anna, who was now swaying gently, her face pale, almost translucent in the flickering candlelight. "She volunteered."

Legba chuckled, a hollow sound that echoed through the room. "You're a good man, Jam. You kept your side of the bargain. Swift and efficient, as always. A real credit to Shadow Falls."

I felt a prickle of unease. "Hold on, Daddy Longlegs. We ain't done yet. You said you'd give me something I'd been searching for. You said you'd pay me back for what I did."

The green glow in Anna's eyes intensified, almost pulsating with the rhythm of her heartbeat. "I rescued her, Jam. The woman you sought, the soul you saved from the woods. That's what I promised, isn't it?"

I scoffed, my frustration building. "You found a Charlaine, a someone, but you promised me something. A human ain't a thing, Longlegs." 

Legba’s voice, through Anna, took on a menacing tone. "The deal is done, Sheriff. You saved a soul, I gave you a soul. Now, I must be gone." 

"No, you ain't gone," I said, my voice gaining a steely edge. "You're still in my debt, Daddy Longlegs. You're gonna keep your promise, or I'm gonna make you."

For a moment, there was silence. The only sound was Cerberus, Mama Marie's hound, whining softly. Then, the wind outside picked up, howling around the ramshackle hut. The candles flickered, casting dancing shadows on the walls. A low rumble of thunder echoed through the air, and the lights flickered again, plunging the room into near darkness. 

Lightning struck, a blinding flash that momentarily illuminated the grimy windows. A loud boom shook the house, and something outside exploded. A wave of heat washed over us, followed by the pungent scent of ozone. 

Charlaine kicked me discreetly under the table. "Maybe you should lay off the deity-baiting, Jam." Her voice was low, almost a whisper.

Suddenly, the storm passed. The lights flickered back on, and the room was bathed in the soft glow of candlelight once more. The only sound left was the insistent whining of Cerberus and the rumble of a deep, guttural laugh.

"You're a stubborn one, Sheriff," Legba's voice echoed through Anna. "But I'm a man of my word. You'll have your answer. But it comes with a price, a cost, a sacrifice."

I watched Anna's face, the green glow in her eyes intensifying with each word. "What kind of sacrifice?"

A wicked smile played on Legba’s lips. "Something precious, Sheriff. Something you hold dear." He paused, letting the words hang in the air. Then, he added, his voice a chilling whisper, "Something you might lose. Something you might not even know you'd miss until it's gone."

I felt Charlaine’s hand tighten on my arm. She was a good kid, loyal as a hound, but too trusting.  Too trusting for this world. I stared at Anna, the glow in her eyes like a pair of green fireflies. "You’re playing a dangerous game, Daddy Longlegs," I said, keeping my voice steady, trying not to betray the rising panic in my gut. 

He chuckled, a dry, crackling sound, like dead leaves underfoot. "I assure you, Sheriff, the danger is all yours." He paused, his gaze fixed on me. "You're a sharp one, Slate. It's not often a trickster gets outsmarted. English is a tricky language, eh? But game recognizes game. You've got guts, I'll give you that."  

I didn't bother with a thank you. It was more of an admission than a compliment.  "Easy there, Legba," I said, my voice hard. "I don’t play games. But a deal is a deal."

"Within reason," he said, his voice softer now. "There’s always a price at the crossroads, Sheriff. What's yours?"

I could feel the heat rising off the candles, making my clay skin itch. I cast a glance at Charlaine, who was staring at me with those big, worried eyes. “What's the price, Jam?” she whispered, her voice barely audible.

“Hold your horses, kid,” I said, my voice as rough as the sandpaper he was using to smooth out the table.  I kept my gaze on Legba. "I'm thinking. It's a big decision, you know?"  

"Of course," the loa said, a sly grin on his face. "Decisions are always the hardest part of the deal. But that's what makes them so worthwhile, isn't it?"
==========
I thought of the many options I had.  What was something I could ask for, something that Legba could provide?  I couldn’t ask for someone, not directly. That was a trap I wouldn’t fall for again. I couldn’t ask for Krabat's location either. That would be too obvious, too easy. The information about the Murder Twins was just as tricky. What good would it be if the person was a ghost from the past or in some Tibetan monastery?

I needed something concrete, something immediate. 

My gaze fell on the chipped voodoo doll sitting on the table. My mind started racing. I knew what I wanted.

“Alright, Daddy Longlegs,” I said, my voice hard. “I’ll play your game. You’re always telling me to loosen up. I’m willing to try something new.”

He tilted his head, a flicker of amusement in his eyes. "You’ve got me intrigued, Sheriff. Tell me. What is it you want?"

"I want you to tell me where I can find some good music." 

He stared at me, his eyes narrowing. He looked from me to Charlaine, then back to me. He let out a deep, throaty laugh, the sound echoing in the small room. “Is that all?” he asked, his voice laced with disbelief. “You’re asking a trickster to point you to good music?”

“It's not just any music, Daddy Longlegs,” I said, a smirk playing on my lips. “It's the kind of music that makes your feet tap and your soul sing.”

He looked at me, a knowing look in his eyes. "You're asking me to help you find the spirit of the music." 

"Exactly," I said, my heart pounding in my chest. "It's a dangerous quest, Daddy Longlegs. A quest for the soul."

A quest for the soul.  He looked at me, a knowing look in his eyes. "You're asking me to help you find the spirit of the music."  "Exactly," I said, my heart pounding in my chest.  "It's a dangerous quest, Daddy Longlegs. A quest for the soul."  "What exactly do you want?" he asked, his voice suddenly sharp, the playful tone gone.  I took a deep breath.  This was it.  The moment of truth.  I took a look at Charlaine.  She was staring at me, her eyes wide with concern.  I knew she was worried.  I knew she was afraid of what might happen.  But she was also ready.  Ready for whatever was coming.  "I need a way to stop those killings," I said.  "A way to keep the citizens safe, without harming anyone else.  I need something that can help me find the source."  His gaze flickered, a calculating gleam in his eyes.  "The source?" he repeated. "That's a very specific request, Sheriff.  A lot of constraints.  Not easy to fulfill."  I stood up, my clay body feeling stiff in the candlelight.  "So you can't do it?" I asked, my voice tight with frustration.  "I never said that, Sheriff," Legba said, a smirk playing on his lips. "But it's not as simple as you think. There's a price to pay."  The storm outside raged, another thunderclap shaking the ground.  I felt a tug in my clay, a warning. I was pushing my luck.  Charlaine kicked me from under the table.  "Jam, we need to go!" she whispered, her voice sharp with urgency.  I didn't need another reminder.  "Just tell me the price," I said, my voice steady.  "Then I can make my decision."

Then I can make my decision. "The price," Legba said, his gaze lingering on Charlaine, "is a choice. A choice between what you want and what you need." I looked at Charlaine. She was shaking her head, trying to warn me, but I couldn’t hear her. I was already making up my mind. "You’re saying it’s impossible?" I asked, my voice low and wary. Legba’s smirk widened. "No, Sheriff," he said, "it's entirely possible. But... you may not like the outcome." His chuckle echoed through the ramshackle hut, making the candles flicker. "You see, Sheriff, sometimes giving what you ask for is more dangerous than giving what you need."  The hound, Cerberus, whined, a low growl rumbling in his chest. He moved closer to Legba, his dark eyes fixed on me. "Go back to city hall, Sheriff," Legba said, waving a hand dismissively. "Wait for the clock to strike noon. The price will be waiting for you." He stood up, his tall, skeletal figure filling the doorway. The storm outside had stopped, leaving an eerie silence in its wake. I looked at Charlaine, her face pale in the dim candlelight. She was gripping my arm, her knuckles white. "Let’s go," I said, my voice rough. I didn’t need any more persuasion. The air inside Mama Marie’s hut was thick with a strange energy. I could feel it tugging at my clay, pulling me closer to something dark and unknown. I wanted to leave, to escape, but a sense of urgency held me there. I had to know what Legba had in store for me. The price, whatever it was, was a burden I was willing to bear. I had to stop those killings. I had to protect Shadow Falls. Even if it meant sacrificing everything.

Legba turned his back on us, a dark shadow in the candlelight. He walked towards Mama Marie, a knowing smile playing on his lips.  

"Would you say your kin has been safely returned, Mama Marie?" he asked, his voice a smooth, honeyed whisper. 

Mama Marie’s wrinkled face creased with a smile, a touch of relief softening her weathered features. "He is safe," she said, her voice low and gravelly. "The deal is made." She lifted her head, her eyes meeting Legba’s, a glint of something dark and unknowable flickering within them. 

I felt Charlaine’s grip tighten on my arm, her knuckles white. Something was wrong. It wasn’t just the unsettling presence of Legba, it was... Mama Marie. Her eyes, usually warm and knowing, were now cold and distant. A shiver ran down my spine. 

Legba stepped closer to Mama Marie, his gaze fixed on her with a disturbing intensity. Then, in a single, fluid motion, he lunged. His fangs, sharp and glistening, sank deep into Mama Marie’s neck. Her body stiffened, her eyes widening in disbelief. A gurgling sound escaped her lips before she crumpled to the floor. 

Charlaine screamed. I felt a surge of primal rage, a wave of heat that threatened to crack my clay body. The scent of blood and fear filled the hut, mingling with the acrid scent of ozone and clove. 

Legba stood over Mama Marie, his fangs still buried in her neck. His smile was wider now, a cruel, mocking thing.  

"I told you, Sheriff," he said, his voice laced with a cold amusement. "Sometimes, giving what you ask for is more dangerous than giving what you need." 

But as he said those words, his form shimmered, shifting.  He wasn’t Legba anymore.  He was… Anna.
