Mama Marie's words hung in the air, thick as the incense smoke swirling around us. The leaves in the saucer spun, a frantic dance, then stilled. A sudden chill gripped the room, like a ghostly hand reaching out to snatch away the warmth. I could feel the hairs on my arms prickle. I glanced at Charlaine, but she was staring at the leaves, her face pale as chalk. 

My gaze darted around the cramped hut, searching for any sign of the spirit. The flickering candlelight cast long shadows on the walls, making every object seem warped and distorted. But there was nothing. 

"Well, Daddy Longlegs, about time you showed your face." My voice was louder than I intended, a nervous bravado meant to mask the unease gnawing at my gut. 

"I still wish you wouldn't call me that." 

The voice was low, almost a whisper, yet it seemed to emanate from everywhere at once.  A shudder ran through me, and I felt Charlaine stiffen beside me. We both knew that voice, though it was altered, a chilling inflection twisting the familiar syllables.

Anna was standing in the doorway, silhouetted against the pale moonlight. Her eyes, usually hidden behind dark sunglasses, were wide open, glowing green, a predatory gleam in their depths. 

"Sheriff Slate," she said, her voice a strange echo of itself, a whisper laced with a chilling cadence, "Mama Marie has been most hospitable. I thank her for her offerings and her hospitality." 

My stomach lurched. It wasn't Anna talking. It was Legba, the Loa, the trickster, speaking through her. I shot a furious glance at Mama Marie. 

"He can only manifest at the crossroads," Legba's voice rasped through Anna. "Life and death. The warehouse, the victim, the murderer, all caught in between. A vampire, living yet dead, qualifies, too."

"She volunteered," Mama Marie said, her voice calm despite the turmoil swirling in her eyes. 

I felt a wave of anger wash over me. I should have known. The woman was a priestess, after all. And Anna... well, she had a habit of letting her curiosity get the better of her. And now, the Loa was playing with her, using her as his vessel.

"Ah, yes, the deal," Legba said, a sly amusement in his voice. "We have a deal, Sheriff. I believe I've fulfilled my end of the bargain, wouldn't you agree?"

I tightened my grip on the gun tucked in my holster.  "You found the person I was looking for, all right. But you promised something else. Something I've been searching for. A thing, not a person."  

"The person you found was the person I was looking for," Legba countered, a smug note in his voice. "The deal is complete."

"You're a real card, Daddy Longlegs," I growled. "You think finding someone is the same as finding something?"

"Your words, not mine," Legba sneered. "But fret not, Sheriff. You'll get your something. Just be patient, my friend. You'll see. And you'll thank me for it."

And you'll thank me for it."

For a moment, the air crackled with tension, the only sound the low growl of Cerberus under the porch. Then, a low rumble of thunder echoed through the night, the flickering candlelight casting distorted shadows on the walls. The storm outside picked up, wind whipping at the ramshackle hut.

Charlaine's hand shot out, a sharp nudge to my side. Her eyes, wide and urgent, met mine. The lights flickered, the room plunged into darkness for a heartbeat. Then, a blinding flash of lightning illuminated the room, followed by a deafening boom that rattled the windows. 

Outside, something exploded, a shockwave of energy rippling through the air. I could see Mama Marie's face pale with fear. Then, as suddenly as it began, the storm subsided. Silence settled, broken only by the whine of Cerberus and a guttural laugh that sent shivers down my spine.

"Daddy Longlegs," I growled, my voice tight with apprehension, "what in the hell was that?"

"Just a little... reminder," Legba's voice, now smooth and deceptively casual, filtered through Anna. "Patience, Sheriff. Everything happens in its own time."

He pulled back, the glazed look in Anna's eyes fading as the Loa's presence receded. She blinked, her gaze confused. "What happened?"

"Nothing," I said, my eyes glued to Anna. "Nothing at all."

For a moment, Legba didn't respond. The storm outside brewed, the wind whipping at the rickety walls. The lights flickered, and a low rumble of thunder shook the house. Then, a flash of lightning split the night, followed by a deafening boom that rattled the windows.  Something outside exploded, a shockwave of energy rippling through the air. Mama Marie's face went white, her eyes wide with fear. But just as quickly as it began, the storm subsided. Silence settled, broken only by the whine of Cerberus and a guttural laugh that sent chills down my spine. 

Charlaine kicked me under the table, a sharp nudge. "Maybe you should lay off the Daddy Longlegs jokes, Jam," she whispered, her voice low and urgent. "You don't wanna piss off a god, even a trickster god." 

"It's rare for a trickster to be outsmarted, Sheriff. You're clever, I'll give you that." Legba’s laugh rumbled through Anna. “English is a tricky language. Game recognizes game, they say.”

"What do you want, Legba?"

"Name your price, Sheriff. Within reason, of course. What is it you truly desire? Remember, there's always a price at the crossroads."

His words hung in the air, thick and heavy like the scent of incense that permeated Mama Marie's hut. I chewed on the inside of my cheek, trying to think straight. Legba was a crafty son of a gun, and this was a classic trickster move. He was dangling a carrot in front of me, a promise of something I desperately wanted. But what?

I couldn't ask for someone. Krabat was off the table. Asking for his location was a gamble I wasn't willing to take again. I'd set a dangerous precedent with Charlaine's release. And I couldn't ask for who was behind the murder twins. What good would that do if they were some big cheese from out of town, or stuck in some Tibetan monastery halfway around the world?

I needed something I could actually use, something that could help me keep the peace in Shadow Falls. I needed to know. I had a hunch.

"Tell me," I said, my voice steady despite the knot of tension in my gut, "who set the fire in the old mill last week?"

I had a hunch. "Tell me," I said, my voice steady despite the knot of tension in my gut, "who set the fire in the old mill last week?"

Legba leaned back, his eyes gleaming like a pair of polished stones in the flickering candlelight. A crooked grin stretched across his face. "Ah, a detective's curiosity. A worthy pursuit, Jam. But even a master detective needs the right tools to solve a case."

I didn't like the sound of that. "What are you saying, Daddy Longlegs?"

He tapped his bony finger on the worn tabletop. "This is a delicate matter. You're asking me to pinpoint the source of the poison. A delicate operation, Jam. A lot of moving parts."

I glanced at Charlaine, her face pale under the dim light. The storm outside was getting worse. Thunder boomed, rattling the windows.  A flash of lightning momentarily illuminated the room, highlighting the voodoo artifacts around us, and the unsettling grin on Legba's face. 

"Look, I'm not asking for names, okay?"  I said. "I'm asking for a way to stop it. A way to cut it off at the source." I pointed my finger at the old man. "I need to stop these killings, these abductions, before anyone else gets hurt."

Legba's grin widened. "Very specific. A lot of constraints. A difficult request, my dear detective."

"So you can't do it?" I was starting to get impatient. 

Another rumble of thunder outside. I felt a sharp pain in my ankle. Charlaine must've kicked me again. I winced. "Yeah, I know. You're not exactly a walk in the park, are you, Daddy Longlegs?"

"A walk in the park?" Legba snorted, his eyes flickering with amusement. "You've been in a bit of a rush, haven't you, Jam?"

I was losing my patience.  "Look, I have to get back to the station. The longer I'm here, the more likely something else happens. Just tell me what I need to know and let me go." 

Legba's grin didn't falter. "Patience, my dear detective. We're getting to the good part."

We're getting to the good part." Legba's eyes narrowed, like a cat sizing up a mouse. He was playing with me, stringing me along. I was tired of his games. I glanced at Charlaine, her lips pursed, her eyes burning with a quiet anger. She knew this was just another one of Legba's tricks. 

"So, you can do it?" I asked, my voice edged with steel. "You can tell me how to stop this?"

Legba leaned back, his bony fingers tapping a slow rhythm on the worn tabletop. "It can be done, Jam. But…" He paused, his gaze lingering on me, "you might not like the outcome." A flicker of amusement danced in his eyes. 

Another boom of thunder rattled the windows. The candlelight flickered, casting long, distorted shadows across the walls. I shifted my weight, my ankle throbbing with a dull ache. Charlaine had kicked me again. I was getting agitated. "What are you saying?" 

Legba chuckled, a dry, brittle sound that echoed through the room. "Giving you what you ask for, but not what you need. Now, wouldn't that be a twist?" He rose from his chair, his movements slow and deliberate. "Go back to city hall, Jam. Wait for the clock to strike noon."

He gestured towards the door. "I'll have my little surprise waiting for you."

Legba's grin was like a cracked mirror, reflecting something twisted and cruel. He turned his back on us, his bony hand resting on Mama Marie's shoulder.  "Well, Marie, would you say your kin has been safely returned?"

Mama Marie nodded, her eyes fixed on the flickering candle flame. She was a tough old bird, but even she looked shaken. "Yes, Elegba. I am ready."

Before I could even register what was happening, Legba lunged.  He was a blur of shadow and bone, a grotesque parody of grace.  His long, bony fingers reached for Mama Marie's neck, his eyes gleaming with a unholy hunger.   A flicker of red, an unnatural redness, flashed beneath his pale skin, the same shade as the blood that spurted from Mama Marie's throat.   He was using Anna's body, but the eyes were his own, the eyes of a god who’d forgotten how to be human.

Charlaine, her face white as a sheet, stumbled back. The air reeked of ozone and cloves, the telltale scent of the Murder Twins. 

"You son-of-a-bitch!" I roared, already moving, but Legba was too quick. He pulled back, his fangs dripping with Mama Marie's blood, and his laughter echoed around the room. A hollow, echoing sound, like a wind whistling through a graveyard.  

He glanced at Charlaine. "Well, child, did you enjoy the show?" He licked his lips, the crimson stain staining his teeth. "A family reunion of sorts, wouldn't you say?"

I launched myself at him, a whirlwind of clay and fury. He laughed again, his laughter like a blade cutting through the air. He sidestepped, a blur of movement, and slammed me against the wall. I felt the impact in my bones, a dull throb that resonated through my clay body.  

He leaned in close, his hot breath on my face. “You’re a fool, Jam. You always were. And your little friend here," he gestured towards Charlaine, "well, she's just as foolish as you."

Charlaine, though frozen in place, took a step forward. "Leave him alone, Legba." Her voice was a quiet tremor, but her eyes were fire. 

Legba smiled. "You’re brave, child. But bravery isn't going to save you." He stepped back, his eyes glinting in the candlelight. "I've a feeling you're going to be very useful, Charlaine. Very useful indeed.”

I watched as he moved towards the back room, leaving Charlaine and me in the flickering candlelight. The air reeked of death and decay, the stench of a sacrifice made. The smell of cloves lingered, but something else had been added to the mix, something sharp and metallic. It wasn't a smell, it was a taste, a taste that made my insides twist.  

I knelt beside Mama Marie, her blood staining the cracked tile floor. Her eyes were wide open, staring at the ceiling, and a single tear rolled down her cheek. 

Charlaine was at my side, her hand on my arm. I looked at her, and her eyes were filled with a mixture of fear and determination. 

“We’ve gotta get out of here,” she whispered, her voice trembling. 

I knew she was right. We needed to get out of here, but we didn't know where Legba had taken Mama Marie, or what he intended to do with her. But one thing was for sure, the price of this reunion was higher than I could have imagined. We were just pawns in a game we didn't understand, and the stakes were higher than ever before. 

We had to get out of here before Legba came back for us, and maybe, just maybe, we could find a way to bargain with him. 

I rose to my feet, the scent of ozone and blood stinging my nostrils. The air grew thick, heavy with the weight of what we’d seen.  

And then the ground shook beneath my feet. The candlelight flickered, casting dancing shadows across the walls. The room began to spin, the air growing heavy and suffocating.

I knew what this was. It was the sound of a god laughing.
